4209,did you try calling her on the telephone ?,"the telephone . you know , leonard , in your own simple way , you may be the wisest of us all . voice mail . curiouser and curiouser ."
9666,hey .,hello .
7609,"sheldon , you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny .","what am i supposed to do , eat french toast on a monday ? now , that would be impossible ."
7872,"you’re right , all sex has is nudity , orgasms and human contact .",my point .
3149,"our dreams are very small , aren’t they ?","good news , gentlemen , i have tentatively accepted…"
2903,"you can stare at your board all day sheldon , she’s still going to be right .","i’m not staring , i’m mulling ."
7497,"sheldon , that’s very rude . she helped you with your show . the right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play .","oh , so many crazy rules ."
4862,don’t make this hard for me .,"it’s not hard . it’s simple . you can either sit with me , your friend , colleague and roommate , or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with ."

8246,"you know , there was a time when i was alone and had no friends . im starting to miss that .",he still hasnt responded . whats taking him so long ?
6108,"sheldon , im sorry i didnt tell you about the surgery , but you were worried about nothing .","oh , youre hardly out of the woods , no . you still run the risk of infection , a blood clot , the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose . the minute you sneeze web , im moving out ."

9620,maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements .,"oh , please . if i wanted to take up a fad , i’d get a tramp stamp ."
7837,anything else i should know .,yes . if you use my toothbrush i’ll jump out that window . please don’t come to my funeral . have a good night .

5479,"whuh-ah ! woah ! you can’t talk about that , either , dr . cooper . your language is entirely inappropriate , and i’m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now .","i don’t see why i’m the one being persecuted here . dr . hofstadter , he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen . you know , and howard wolowitz , he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot . oh , and at the office christmas party , i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar ."

5933,"im sorry , but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night .","there you go , perfect ."
7592,"uh , sorry guys , that girl is freaky !",come again ?
3574,sheldon .,fine . sorry .
93,"excuse me , i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis .",it doesn’t need proving .
4613,"you know , lets just come up with something new .","you know , a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction . the , the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c . clarke . the motorola flip phone , that came from star trek . and ive long suspected that the idea of an african-american president was stolen from the movie deep impact ."
2358,"professor tupperman is dead , and that makes us ?",sad .
3355,"if youre trying to make me feel better , its not working .",well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill ?
1188,that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come .,"oh , right , yes , i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian , arabic and farsi . why can’t she get her own tv ."

7590,"i’m not . and penny’s qualities , both good and bad , are what make her who she is .","you mean , like that high-pitched , irritating laugh ?"
3014,"if it helps you sleep , then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman ?","really leonard . insults ? after i spent two hours in your closet , waiting for you to fall asleep ?"
8090,he can’t help it . he can’t . he really can’t .,"oh , wait here . i’ll get some alka-seltzer , we can build that rocket , and we can sh**t it at bill nye’s house . as long as i’m not within 500 feet of it ."
8557,"all right , mister , i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology .","perhaps you’re right . i’m sorry for my behaviour . i’ve had alcohol , and it’s caused me to be inappropriate ."

2210,"sheldon , this date is probably my one chance with penny , what happens if i blow it .","well , if we accept your premise , and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely , bitter old man with no progeny . the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind ."
6604,that’s not really necessary .,"no , no . i’ll finish making the tea , while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you ."
5229,"if i didn’t have you , life would be blue , i’d be dr . who without the tardis .","is it me , or does she not look so good ?"
6733,"yeah , we’re coming for you , todd zarnecki . and for the record , legoland is more interactive .","i almost feel sorry for the poor fool , sitting in his split-level suburban ranch , unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the san diego freeway at 71 miles an hour . ease up there , lead foot . you trying to get us k*ll ?"

3131,there’s nothing wrong with the science here .,perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science .
3785,"nope , i wanna climb some wocks .","this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop . no , one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons ."
9162,k*ll me .,it wouldn’help . the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death .
952,"sweetheart , you are a grown man .","or maybe i’m part of a new species , that lives for hundreds of years , which means i’m still basically a toddler ."
7201,"i dont know what to tell you . i mean , why dont you talk to her ?","is that all you have ? shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go ? gee , penny , lifes giving me lemons . what should i do ?"
9719,"yeah , fine , whatever . the point is , you’re wrong again .",we haven’t established that i’m wrong once .
2910,"regardless , i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley , i’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy .",leonard ?
3739,"alright sheldon , why is tapioca…",tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta . due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly .
1147,wow .,"yeah , well , it’s just some quantum mechanics , a little string theory doodling around the edges . that part there , that’s just a joke , it’s a spoof of the bourne-oppenheimer approximation ."
5756,"oh , my god , are you okay ?","no , im not okay . uh , im wearing borrowed pants , i dont have i . d . , and one of the officers here wont stop calling me chicken legs ."

6613,i didn’t do the audition .,"given the state of your career , can you really afford to be picky ?"
7766,yes . i also found a korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage . what happened last night ?,"ah , memory impairment , the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle ."
1891,"what if he’s right ? and by not participating in gossip , society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish ?","fine . in the parlance of the urban music scene , what’s the 4-1-1 ?"
2935,you always get your way .,i’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring .
3405,did that feel good ? you feel like a big man now ?,"i was going to make you red zinger , but since mars is the red planet , i went with peppermint ."
7038,"not always . unless your date drives a van with an air mattress , then always .","well , if its part of the prom experience , then im open to it ."
5504,"well , then prepare to be terrified . if your friends are unconvincing , this year’s donations might go to , say , the geology department .","oh , dear , not , not the dirt people !"
4328,hey ! look ! amazing spider-man 183 .,got it .
5155,m-hmm .,"yeah , wait , here . for your troubles ."
2492,"you know what ? i’m not driving you to work , because you’re incredibly annoying .","you say one thing and do the other , so then you are driving me and you find me a delight ."

7188,"well , thats fascinating . i cant wait to read it .","oh , no , me as well . uh , please e-mail it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz . why dot biz ? because i just gave you the business . and also bazinga dot com was taken ."
5981,really ? you figured out the graphene problem ?,"no , no , i’m still hopelessly stuck on that , but i figured out how to figure it out ."
107,"you should just talk to him , i’m sure you guys can work this out .",it’s certainly preferable to my plan .
7242,"oh , thanks , man .",you didn’t have to do that .
8105,right .,is it about me or the dead pixels ?
4140,"hmm , how about , gee , penny , you’re smarter than i thought . you may be the one in school , but i’m the one who learned a lesson . i’m so stupid , penny . duh .",she sounds exactly like you .
1888,"you can think about heisenberg’s uncertainty principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain chinese restaurants , where you have dishes in column a and other dishes in column b , and if you order the first dish in column a , you can’t order the corresponding dish in column b . that’s sort of like the uncertainly principle .",ba-dum-bump .
7506,"uh , hang on . empty your pockets .",why ?
2526,okay .,"oh , great , now , i work the controls , i say all aboard . you sit quietly and watch ."
1393,"okay , what’s wrong with it ?",– what’s wrong with it ?
5471,at least i know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend .,"good to know . yeah , a few more helpful hints like that , you may find yourself on the council of ladies . hello . i see . uh , what time ? very well , then . huh . that was the human resources department at the university . apparently , my assistant alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace ."
8728,you got it . i already have your address .,what a nice girl .
1402,i just don’t see how see can pull this off .,"okay , that , right there , that equivocation and self-doubt , that is not the american spirit . did davy crockett quit at the alamo ? did jim bowie ?"
7735,would you like to come in for a nightcap ?,"if you’re referring to the beverage , you know i don’t drink . if you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle , i have one ."
8080,why is it odd ?,"because as it just so happens , i’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality . isn’t that right , new friend and colleague bill nye the science guy . sorry , i replaced you with a newer model ."
1790,i went to art school .,equally ridiculous . let’s go .
700,you can have soup delivered .,"i did not think of that . clearly febrile delirium is setting in , please bring me some soup while i still understand what a spoon is for ."

3844,"a , that was not a joke , that was a sincere request . and b , more importantly , i was the outsider to this group , and i know how frightening that can be . but you guys took me in and made me feel loved , like i was family .","fine , i’ll do it ."
4889,"you need to let it go , sheldon .","you work tirelessly for someone , and this is what you get ."

7779,"tempting choices , but i have something special planned for tonight .",what can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny lego indiana jones ?

330,we’re not living together .,do i have to pull out the paperwork again ?

333,thank you .,didn’t they teach you that in medical school ?
5328,we want you back on the project with us .,"well , well , well , did you hear that , howard ?"
2816,why ?,"he said it’s why they hired me , it’s , it’s what my grant was designated for , and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do . he then gave an example of something he had to do , even though he didn’t want to , which was look at my stupid face ."

1313,"hey , will you steam my uniform next ?","interesting . do you recall this conversation ? leonard , want to go halfsies on a steamer ? no , sheldon , we don’t need a steamer . looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost ."
3297,"bells are ringing , children singing , all is merry and bright . so hang your stockings and say your prayers cause santa claus is coming tonight . whyd you turn it off ?","because in the last ten minutes , santa came to town , kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer . i had a drunk uncle who did all those things . nobody sings songs about him ."
1623,"oh , awesome . we-sa gonna go into the movie now . bye-bye .","this is indiana jones , not star trek . there should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here . and even at star trek conventions , they only let him in if he helps set up ."
1245,wow . talk dirty to me .,"i know it doesn’t seem like it to you , but , for me , what we have is extremely intimate ."
95,"alright , i don’t care what you say , i’m going to the conference and i’m presenting our findings .",and i forbid it .

2225,"oh , that sounds like fun .",all right . what were the symptoms ?
3502,"sheldon , do you realize i dont live with the woman i love because of you ? no other reason . just you .",is that true ?
8968,i meant more like a little brother .,"oh . well , i suppose i do think of you as a sister . and sometimes , a mother ."
7702,"we were in here first , you can’t be in here .","according to the roommate agreement , paragraph nine , subsection b , the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure . and believe me , i am experiencing a very majeure force ."
4376,i’m glad you’re enjoying yourself .,and you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us .
2145,"oh , they’re all up there , huh ? hmm , typical .","it’s axiomatically atypical . up until recently , they did not know alicia , and had no encounters with her in a previous location . they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants , so your characterization of their behaviour as typical is demonstrably fallacious ."
6189,"aren’t there any other options ? there’s not a lot of room , it’s gonna be uncomfortable .","yes , yes . yeah , i’m definitely going with colonoscopy ."
3381,okay .,"as you know , amy and i have been together a long time , and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible ."
5972,"sure , sure . how did you get into this place ?","back door has a five-pin tumbler system , single-circuit alarm . child’s play . you can start sorting protons and neutrons while i build carbon atoms ."
4828,why ?,"her research methodology is sloppy , she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity , and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me ."
8619,"it’s great , isn’t it ?","it is . aligns the lumbar , cradles the coccyx , balances the buttocks . this is a chair worthy of the name ."
6500,what ?,explain your sneeze .
5215,nan,there’s nothing happy about it . i’m being given credit that i don’t deserve .
5841,"we all do . now , how about dinner ?","oh , i would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards . we could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them , they’ll just grow back . oh ! my life-size cardboard mr . spock is here ! i know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion , but , oh goodie , oh goodie , oh goodie . commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded ."
2252,just going to skip over that insult .,what insult ?
3481,"ah , interesting , were being accused of making you do things you dont like , and here you are , doing the same thing to poor amy .",you should point out the hypocrisy of that .
6177,"its one thing to make yourself miserable , but youre making everyone around you miserable , too . now , im telling you for the last time , take the cap off .","oh , really ? what if i dont ? and before you answer that , can i have my dessert ?"
4534,what pressure ? all i said was you look handsome . can you please open the door ?,its not just that . leonard and penny also made comments about it . and im not blind . even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants .
4608,oh . i never saw that .,really ?
2943,you’re right . let’s talk about your grandmother .,no ! i call no meemaws .
6903,"this is fun , huh ? we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch , have a hot dog , watch the game .",whoa . nobody said anything about watching the game .
8186,i suppose that’s fair . what do you suggest ?,"in a perfect world , i’d lock you in a stockade in the public square . that probably requires a permit ."
4870,"sheldon , come back , you’re losing me .","leslie winkle , penny . she belittles my research ."
7785,yes .,"i see what you’re doing . you’re attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game , admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood , but it won’t work ."
6927,you’re kidding .,"no , sir , no , i took my dad’s desk chair , attached a speak & spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat . granted most people thought i was r2-d2 , but still , i got a lot of candy ."
2337,"well , i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure .",pchew !
1650,"so , what kind of things are they… will you stop that ?","i can’t help it , i feel like a teen heartthrob ."
9584,additional data . you dog .,"i’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog , but all right ."

4712,a few months .,"and of those few months , how long have you been a demented sex pervert ?"
8628,"sheldon , you do this all the time . you fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion .",name one time i’ve ever done that .

1862,"well , you know , i do understand what you’re going through .",really ? did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing stolen from you ?
8732,"so funny . but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity , i have to tell you , i found it physically exhilarating .",my hypotheses tend to have that effect .
2742,i’m trying . don’t yell at me .,"for goodness’ sake , he’s wearing a hat , glasses , and a red striped shirt ."
3091,"hey , what if i took your class ?",why would you do that ?
1156,here we go .,"in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm , and yet not so close as to cause perspiration . in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there , and there . it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct , thus discouraging conversation , nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion , i could go on , but i think i’ve made my point ."
1550,yep . your turn .,"oh , amy . and you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies . tic-tac-toe can only end in win , lose or draw , none of which will deny me closure . especially since i’m about to win . b-but we didn’t finish ."
4716,go to your room .,but i occupy the moral high ground .
2215,crazy man . call the police .,"no . don’t call the library . show me your mucus . oxen are in my bed ! many , many oxen ! oy vey !"

6933,you walk away .,walking away .
7669,let’s get you to the hospital .,"so this is how it ends , with cruel irony . just as i make the commitment to preserving my body , i am betrayed by my appendix , a vestigial organ . do you know the original purpose of the appendix , leonard ?"

6583,"excuse me , we’re ready .","no , we’re not . let’s say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis , i now lay the following conundrum at your feet , which size ?"
6543,"morning , sheldon .",morning . i trust you had a pleasant night .
408,i already found a guy online who’s willing to sell .,how do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the comic-con police ?
2013,that .,okay . i think we’ve found the problem here . it’s not the table at all . it’s you .
2098,"au contraire . i’m 26 years old , i’m originally from denton , texas , but i was a navy brat so i was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world , as a result i’ve often felt like an outsider , never really fitting in , which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem .","excuse me , we just went over this . as the quintessential middle child , your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention ."
6553,well…,no .
6495,i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you .,i’ll go as high as 40 .

4304,"all right , five . one , two , three , four , five . oh , wow , look at that , my department of defence research grant is renewed .",oh ! great roll ! now you can demolish your soviet-style cyclotron and build the large hadron collider .
2807,please go away .,said pharoah to moses .
1527,the bird ?,"yeah , it’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes ."
1369,"sheldon , wait ! will you ?","just to be clear here , you’re asking for my assistance ."
4685,"so , you think shell be single soon ?","oh , if you want to get in on the pool , youre too late . all the squares have been purchased ."
2954,problem ?,this is thai food .
7531,"yeah , i know it’s on , sheldon . oh , no , no , no , no , no . i cannot afford this right now .","maybe it’s just something minor . ooh , good news , the light just went out ."
7825,"let me guess , you have a problem with this .",where do i begin ?
6603,"yeah , that’s a real pickle . bye .","don’t worry . as your tertiary friend , i am prepared to step in and comfort you ."
6726,no one’s getting tortured .,"fine , we’ll abide by the geneva convention . but ask yourself this , in the course of our lives , how much lunch money has been taken from us ? how many kites ? how many scooby-doo trapper keepers ?"
1349,"oh , great , my rhinestones . thank you .",excuse me .
6399,thank you .,"simultaneously , a festival of cloying clichés . you sicken me ."
5216,"oh , people get things they don’t deserve all the time . look at me with you .","no , leonard , this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life . every science classroom , every periodic table , every textbook , this mistake will be staring back at me . like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows . i’ve got to find a way to stop this thing ."
9030,then i guess congratulations are in order .,"no , congratulations will have been in order . you know , i’m not going to enjoy this party ."
1277,"okay , here’s an idea . what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel ?",that could work .
7328,"sheldon , i think this will work . let’s just try it my way .","oh , i’m , i’m sorry . i assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees , but i realize now , you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men ."
1222,you guys enjoy your evening . i’m gonna go before i ruin anybody else’s weekend .,"ah , that’s my girl ."
2232,hoo .,zack .
6201,"but it’s one o’clock , you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock .",her reasoning is unassailable . it is one o’clock .
2072,"i’m sorry , i’m not seeing the help .","she was going to see through your lie eventually , so i told her that you were lying to protect me ."
1851,do not make a sound .,whispering do not make a sound is a sound .
5883,what are you doing ? its time to go .,im not going to work today . and would you like to know why ?
1775,"funny . we’re always giving each other a hard time up here . it’s kind of like being in a frat . you know , joking , kidding around , hurting feelings .","okay , my turn . let me talk to him ."
745,"guys , in 30 seconds , we went from lets change the world to lets watch tv .",im sorry . is that a no ?

7565,"sheldon , you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny .","what am i supposed to do , eat french toast on a monday ? now , that would be impossible ."
3509,im not leaving your world . im just talking about living across the hall .,"i understand . either way , i want you to know that im aware of how difficult i can be . so i just want to say thank you for putting up with me ."
5503,"and consider this , without you to make the case for the physics department , the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh .",are you trying to scare me ? ‘cause you’re succeeding .
4622,i dont know . you did it to me .,"oh , im going with it . marty and doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015 . that means 2015 biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff . therefore , the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac . and not just never gets . never have , never hasnt , never had have hasnt ."
6066,hey . whatre you working on ?,"remember when i said if you went through with your surgery , there was a one-in-700 , 000 chance of dying ?"

9556,"i’m sorry , i meant questions about the food .","oh , of course . um , is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the miller hook and platform ?"
7963,"so , what are you supposed to be ?",me ? i’ll give you a hint . neeeeooooowwwww !
7630,what could she possibly be talking about for so long ?,"obviously , waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity , that requires a great deal of analysis and planning . bazinga ! you know , using positive reinforcement techniques , i could train that behaviour out of her in a week ."
8034,so did i .,do you think theyre gonna call the police ?
5848,that doesn’t make it true .,"it’s called non-fiction for a reason , leonard ."
5958,i thought i smelled popcorn .,"pattern is the same as fermions , travels on the pathways , hexagonal , it’s always hexagonal…"
3956,"hi , sheldon . everything okay ?","no , it’s not . i’ve seen things . lady things ."
7468,"hey , sheldon ?",yes ?
427,shh .,whose house is this ?
653,what did you write ?,im done hiding from bullies . im taking this into the real world .
3960,doing laundry ?,"of course i’m doing laundry . saturday night is laundry night , and i’m in a laundry room , so , i believe your inference is justified ."
4110,"oh , you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points .","amy . why would you give me a word ? now , if i play extract it would be cheating ."
7317,"hey , why am i in charge of phone support ? seems a bit r*cist .",a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres .
7719,"okay , suit yourself . we’ll probably be trashing priya a little .",g*n .
4483,oh . is it amy ?,"its dark matter . when i entered the field of string theory , i was a prodigy . i rose to a position of respect , and i assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory . now here i am in my 30s , im back at square one . and , frankly , its frightening ."
1558,and ?,"doesn’t matter , does it ?"
8663,and i had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad’s estate .,"the papers could have been mailed , mom just sent you here to spy on me , didn’t she ."
611,"okay , i found the box . now what ?","you’re holding a japanese puzzle box , which takes ten precise moves to open . first , locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left . then , on the opposite end of the box , slide the entire panel down two millimetres . you’ll hear a slight click ."
5646,"wow , that flag is a lifesaver .",no . this is . stop looking at my legs .
5628,"okay . now , we all run out . sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees . raj , howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks . then we’ll all have a great view as penny runs out and k*ll everyone else in sight .","right , just one thing before we start ."
4827,what about leslie winkle .,oh no .
8458,"ive been thinking about them , too , sheldon . being your girlfriend is so challenging . emotionally , physically . ive been incredibly patient for years .",strongly disagree . go on .
4671,yes .,"uh , extra peanut sauce ?"
8774,"oh , please , i just offered a little encouragement .","it was a lot more than that . you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions , and you pumiced my hammer toe . how can i ever repay you ?"
554,do you think i would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match ?,"no , i suppose not ."
4299,"it’s nice to meet you , too , sheldon . i honestly didn’t believe amy when she told me she had a boyfriend .",i assure you i am quite real and i’m having regular intercourse with your daughter .
511,i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes .,these are my own bowling shoes .
7255,is that really true ?,"of course , thats how you know its a good joke . it not only entertains , it informs ."
4890,"oh , my god , they’re just making you use your vacation days .",but i don’t want a vacation .
967,"you’re just coitusing with me , aren’t you ?",bazinga .
6682,i drink .,"to drinking . nope . oh , if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt ."
9117,hi sheldon .,"here , look , look , i found my missing neutrino ."
1608,excellent .,"i rest my case . amy , don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line ?"
6244,"no , no , no , no , no . you just need , you just need , you just need to map it out . come on , i’ll help you . so , uh , you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times ?",yes .

8098,i guess you’re right . see you later .,wait ! leonard ! wait ! what am i going to do for dinner ?
3723,"oh , and , uh , check this out . i took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us .",hello . this is sheldon .
1109,"it was nice , you know . a lot of people showed up , told some great stories about him . did you know that arthur’s son is a high school sci… ? hey , the guys are about to start jedi . you want to go watch ?",i do . after i make them go back and watch one through five first .
7377,what does that mean ?,a disappointing drink for a disappointing day .
9113,it’s a lease .,i’m confused . was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included ?
1038,"we’ll miss you , sheldon .","yeah , well , who wants to spend the whole weekend , running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters . that’s for babies ."
3058,"come on , smile . this is gonna be my christmas card .",you know this is all your fault .
7393,"bored . okay . these are steve maddens . these are nine west . these are target . oh , but don’t they look like chanel ? these are michael kors . these are roxy . these are sachel’s . oh , these are betsy johnson , they’re so cute…","nobody knows the trouble i’ve seen , nobody knows my sorrow…"
9319,aaargh . what the hell ?,emergency preparedness drill .
5074,what ?,we have to stop at pottery barn .
8739,there won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit .,"oh , good one ."
8215,"i know this isnt my area , and i could never do the math like you can , but could this be something ?","well , you could have set newtons gravitational constant to one . and , ugh , the whole thing reeks of blueberry . you know i cant stand these scented markers ."
934,i’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there .,i can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me .
4439,"speaking of new careers , how are things going with dark matter , sheldon ?","oh , yeah , id have to say its the most exiting time in the history of the field ."
394,that’s it ? you’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment ?,"no . you’re my friend , and , i’m sorry ."
3142,"sure , maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death .",sarcasm ?
6032,you laughed .,did you laugh ?
5942,"you lie down , hell be here in a minute .","okay . hey , i thought you were trying to trick me ."
9687,"what’s there to learn ? you get naked , do nasty things to each other , then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami . easy peasy .",perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction .
1941,you know what ? let’s just get a pizza .,good idea . we’ll go to corleone’s .
1877,please know that we are truly…,grateful .
1162,"yes , i remember .",i resent you saying we don’t have company .
4560,"okay , good night .","nice to meet you , professor proton . nice to meet you , professor proton . nice to meet you , professor proton . nice to meet you , prof… ow ! leonard ?"
4113,the guy’s a genius . maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him .,not challenging ? i was humiliating the man . i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl .
6270,"my point is , priya’s gone . and it would be much better if no-one else found out about this .","you mean , you want me to keep a secret ."
4429,"oh , okay , yeah , hang on a sec .","fyi , i was defrosting a steak in there ."
58,sheldon…,zip it pip it . can i have your phone number ?
6081,"he probably got a new one . finish your breakfast . look , theres an entire section of my dashboard that doesnt have any syrup on it .",youre acting odd . why ?
4241,"no , no . maybe a little .",may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy .
4913,because leonard just pissed me off . am i being an idiot or not ?,"no , i don’t think you are ."
4291,all right .,way to go on the details .
7932,we’re really more… .,no .
3160,sheldon .,penny .
5703,"well , you have three strikes . one , coming in . two , sitting down . and three , i don’t like your attitude .","you can’t do that . not only is it a violation of california state law , it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy ."
1496,"gentlemen , there’s a task i’m trying to accomplish here , and i’m having trouble doing it .","oh , my . president siebert , i don’t mean to be an alarmist , but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia . if you’re interested , i can send you a link to a youtube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam . yeah , uh , helpful hint , trim your nails first ."
2239,"let’s look at this logically . i have a stomach , i get hungry . i have genitals , i have the potential for sexual arousal .","a cross we all must bear . you know , in difficult moments like this , i often turn to a force greater than myself ."
3745,"yeah , i’ll do that .",well i think we’re off to a terrific start .
676,"sheldon , you are not sick . this is , but you are not .",we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment . and having never been to nebraska i’m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies .
6547,"that’s very thoughtful , but i think i’ll finish my coffee first .","ah , so the yogurt didn’t work . i’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer ."
7549,"i’m sorry , too . it’s all my fault .","if you weren’t my friend , there’d be a hole in my life ."
9256,"ah , you’re kiwing me , cooper !",can we get back to work ?
3643,"oh , i’ve got it . how about if we replace panels a , b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium .","right , then the entire thing’s one big heat sink ."
4332,"well , that’s not gonna happen .","i assumed that would be your attitude . hence , my true purpose in coming here ."
3208,"boy , this is great . i haven’t had a vacation in ages .","in order to take a vacation , one first has to work ."
3891,because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine .,"you can’t . if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past , you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it , ergo you would still have it . this is a classic rookie time travel mistake ."
8829,"i myself grew up in nebraska . small town outside of omaha . you know , nice place , mostly family farms , a few meth labs .","i’m sorry , how is this better than uncomfortable silence ?"
6850,"we’re gonna have anything can happen thursday , you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and i’m gonna complain about my movie , and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do .","okay . ‘cause if i had to pick now , i’d probably go with dark matter because…"
6557,how am i betraying you ?,"elizabeth’s my friend , and you’re playing with her !"
866,"sheldon , you are right . i’m really sorry . i should’ve known better .",your apology is accepted .
2885,"alright , look , a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re , you know , getting busy .",so you’re saying leonard has a girl in there .
7316,"there’s your answer , free food .","all right , i’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app ."
4992,"no , you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came . so , if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed koothrappali in the back with the w*apon of indifference , it was all of you .","i don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery , we all knew what we were doing ."
4947,i think it’s the only way to look at it .,are you going to help me or not ?
5351,"whatever you do , just don’t make any rash decisions .",i don’t know . i am really aggravated .
6271,yes .,you know i can’t keep a secret .
3934,you know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis ? they devour their mate .,your point being ?
9741,"right , right . you’re saying you talked to penny ?",yes .
9504,"okay , let me try it this way , you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more .","i see . well . at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together , and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears ."
9468,"on earth , we say thank you .","so leonard , how goes the mimesis ?"
9454,yes .,fine .
2152,yes .,"brown rice , not white ?"
4269,certainly . good night .,"good night . leonard , leonard , leonard ,"
1210,sure .,"we can’t have thai food , we had indian for lunch ."
4513,"okay , whats up ?","id like to discuss this party that amy and bernadette are throwing . since you and i are both reluctant to go , i think ive come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it ."
2083,you still told her i lied .,"for a noble purpose , to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin , which i’m assuming is embarrassing , yes ?"
3194,"yes , obviously .","all right . well , given that missing you is predicated on you leaving , logic dictates you must leave ."
8796,"okay , well , what do you communicate about ?","well , my work in physics , her work in neurobiology , and most recently , the possibility of our having a child together ."
1568,"fine , sheldon . you have my undivided attention .","okay , now , the ps4 is more angular and sleek-looking ."
7655,wait a minute . you hate dogs .,a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls . no one can hate that .
8765,i know . when is she going home ?,"never , that’s the problem . i need your help ."
6797,"that , that’s brilliant .","it’s what i do . but wait , there’s more . i also invented two new chess pieces . the serpent , and the old woman ."
617,"i know this isnt my area , and i could never do the math like you can , but could this be something ?","well , you could have set newtons gravitational constant to one . and , ugh , the whole thing reeks of blueberry . you know i cant stand these scented markers ."
2513,"it’s just such a fascinating story . your calculations are way off , but they find the element anyway . it’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure .",can we talk about something else ? do you know that i yodel ?
5361,"look , i , i know this is , this is change , and that sounds scary .",where are you going to go ?
766,"all right , now , one benefit of quantum coupling…","wait , a question , who decides if someones gone off topic ?"
9300,get out .,"well , now , that ."
5595,are you done ?,"no . despite what the name suggests , the civet cat is not a true cat . now i’m done ."
3184,"sheldon , you know i can’t eat butter . i’m lactose intolerant .","way ahead of you , that’s an “i can’t believe it’s not butter” stick ."
1144,"anyway , um . we brought home indian food . and , um . i know that moving can be stressful , and i find that when i’m undergoing stress , that good food and company can have a comforting effect . also , curry is a natural laxative , and i don’t have to that , uh , a clean colon is just… one less thing to worry about .","leonard , i’m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation , you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements ."
5533,"no , i mean , i , i , i got the money first .","smart . get paid up front . yeah , i think you have a real knack for gigolo work , leonard ."
4050,"sheldon cooper , caltech university employee information ?",at the bottom .

8001,"i dont know , um , if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second , given the surface area of this car is about 60 , 000 square centimetres , that means 3 . 9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos ?",i dont want to play anymore .
8678,"sheldon , are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman ?","hmmm ? she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable . it’s noteworth that at other points in history , heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence ."

449,"this might not be that bad . uh , you like telling people theyre wrong .","wrong , just because i enjoyed that one doesnt mean i always do ."
9443,"so , penny doesnâ€™t want me around her friends , i embarrass her . what else could it be ?","well , her actions could be out of concern for your feelings . perhaps sheâ€™s excluded you from these gatherings because sheâ€™s scouting for a new mate and doesnâ€™t want to do it in front of you ."
715,"okay , nice and cosy , okay , i’ll see you later .",wait . will you please rub this on my chest .

1477,"sheldon , you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me . spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science .",all your ideas address the issue at a university level . by then it’s too late . you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences .

7198,im sorry i didnt have a camera .,why would she do this to me ?
9023,"excuse me , sir , you don’t work here .","yes , well , apparently neither does anyone else ."
1807,what is it ?,i like the transformers . do you like the transformers ?

9066,what now ?,"well , there’s some value to taking a multivitamin , but the human body can only absorb so much , what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine ."
5836,"sheldon , that really is an excellent basket .",its not a basket . its a soldiers helmet from 16th century china .
46,excuse me . gablehauser . it’s for you .,"hello . penny , this is not a good time . no , i told you , you’re not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls . you need to be in a group of at least five for that quest , and one should be a level 35 healer . penny , i can’t log on and help you . we’ll talk when i get home . i’m not getting the computing time , am i ?"

9242,you wucky bastard .,"what can i say , you know ? she enjoys my genitals . i am giving them to her on a nightly basis ."
1468,"oh , like yesterday , when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners , the pharmacy and the post office ?",i’m not saying people can’t use tools . even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam .
1665,i think this could be good for you . maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit .,you’re right . i should embrace the chaos .
1416,what for ? it’s not going to rain .,"i know that , but with skin as fair as mine , moon burn is a real possibility ."

6407,going to wheaton’s party is not betraying you .,"oh , of course you would have to believe that . evil always thinks it’s doing right . excuse me , stormtrooper . these are the droids you’re looking for ."
429,what were you trying to ask me at the strip club ?,oh . how much does it cost to get them off my lap ?
6395,"wait , what is going on ?","in case you have forgotten , schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
4891,"okay , listen , i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through , but i’m a little distracted right now .","oh , this again ? so , penny proposed , you didn’t say yes , and now you think you may have lost her love forever . how does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days ?"
385,"no , no , i just need to be alone .","so , a sandwich , a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar . where are you going ?"
6071,"i dont have epilepsy , either .","you dont , but the surgeon might , hmm ? and your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at disneyland ."

6551,"well , now…","excuse me . i’m uncomfortable with you recommending that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr . plimpton , who i assure you has better things to do ."

6623,good news . i made it onto the team for the new defence department laser-equipped surveillance satellite .,"excuse me . if we’re changing topics , i believe i have first dibs with capybara , a rodent the size of a baby hippo ."
5583,"sheldon , is everything okay ?",its too late for koothrappali . lets go .
2191,"no . what i’m saying is , leonard might be different in a good way . obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well .","the last one worked out well for koothrappali . he got a free ipod . oh , glare !"

6426,tuned bayonets .,defend .
1254,is that supposed to be funny ?,i believe it is . the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing .

4032,"okay , i think i have some really great choices . i went on amy’s facebook page and read up on her interests .","now , see , i never would have thought to do that . clearly , i made a good choice farming this out to you . but i am telling you , amy hit the boyfriend jackpot . anyway , my socks are on . let’s knock them off ."
99,get anything good ?,"uh , just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly ."
6062,whats your problem ?,"if the surgery is successful , the snoring is gone . and if you die during surgery , the snoring is gone ."
1456,"all right , you can have a hot chocolate .","as i will not be engaging in this nonsense , my choice of beverage is moot . but for the record , i only drink hot chocolate in months with an r in them ."
1672,"oh , leonard , it’s three o’clock in the morning . i don’t care if richard feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt .",penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun . penny forgot to use the subjunctive .

31,sheldon . shel-don .,"danger , danger ."
3429,"i don’t care for your friend , he’s being rude to me . you need to ask him to leave .","amy , i can’t just ask wil wheaton to leave . he’s a minor celebrity . once you explain who he is , many people recognize him ."
2045,"because… . uh , friday , we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium .",i think that’s a week from tuesday at six .
1360,"fine , cheeseburger .",maybe i’d be better off with nancy .

7512,can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life ?,how about penny’s depressing acting career ?
7226,can you please just let it go ?,"oh , i can help you with that . imagine youre holding an ordinary pen . while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket ."
5212,so you just got lucky ?,sheldon cooper does not get lucky .
1414,we’re all out .,"no problem . i’ll be back before this banana hits the ground . zoom , zoom , zoom , zoom ! zoom , zoom , zoom , zoom !"

754,"okay , so , it wasnt until his 21st birthday that biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions . thats when he altered the timeline .","yeah , but he had will havent placed it !"
2868,"just get a hamburger , you like hamburgers .","i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers , you can’t make the assumption that i’ll like the hamburgers here ."
9346,"uh , not so good . my shrink just k*ll himself and blamed me in the note .","great . great . so , what’s new with your family ? how’s your mother ? is she alive ?"
7212,how ?,what if i told you that over the past few months amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab ?

601,"uh , no , i was talking to my friend , but what’s up ?","what’s up ? i’ll tell you what’s up . i’m in a crisis situation , and i need you to marshal your powers of concentration , limited as they may be…"
8161,"thanks , sheldon . i’ll try that with my father-in-law .","no , you can’t use that one . that’s mine . uh , try this one for an ice-breaker . uh , despite popular lore , there is no place in the continental united states , alaska or hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in china ."
8686,"exactly . and , you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring .","you’re right . if someone wants to get at missy’s fallopian tubes , they’ll have to go through me ."

3411,"you know , sheldon , at any other time , learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day . but a couple of hours ago , we were getting a turtle . and silly as it sounds , i thought that meant something .","amy . oh , why didnt i give her sleepy time tea ? amy , wait . getting a turtle meant a great deal to me , too ."
3399,"sheldon , i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small , but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever .",so youre saying you wouldnt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet ?

5426,i am very disappointed in you . you broke your toy and switched it with leonardâ€™s . you should be ashamed of yourself .,youâ€™re the one who told me to play with it .
1918,do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation ?,it’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that i don’t find repellent .

6151,i dont think thats what you want at all .,"why , of course its what i want . why would i say its what i want if its not what i want ?"
3209,that does seem to be a valid principle .,i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant workers’ solemn oath of ethics and cleanliness . ”
6817,"sheldon , listen to me . i have a big decision to make , and i’m scared .",yellow . go ahead .
3578,here we go .,"thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century . interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth , they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth ."

5214,"you know , sheldon , in neuroscience , we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else .","oh , great . now i’m worse than a fraud . i’m practically a biologist ."
7019,"please , sheldon , i’m a lost indian boy far from home , and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby , and she’ll only come over if she can bring martha .","raj , i highly doubt there is any argument you can make , threat you might levy , rhetorical strategy , plea , invocation , supplication , or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider ."
7957,then what happens ?,that’s as far as i’ve gotten .
3684,hissy fits ? i have hissy fits ?,"yes , and i have a theory why . because of your lactose intolerance , you switched over to soy milk . soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds . i think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman ."

9105,"i’m very proud of you honey , you showed a lot of courage today .","thanks , mom . mom ?"
6854,thank you .,"but to be fair , when you talk , most of what you say sounds like , wah , wah , wah , clothes , wah , wah , wah ."
8638,"what’s the word , hummingbird ?","for your safety , please wait in my apartment as i call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death ."
9159,"that may well be , but the fact is , it wouldn’t k*ll us to meet some new people .","uh , for the record , it could k*ll us to meet new people . they could be m*rder , or the carriers of unusual pathogens , and i’m not insane , my mother had me tested ."
3320,"well , you got me something . here .",cookies ?
6004,"sheldon , this is ridiculous .","is it ? just a moment ago i had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate . bernadette , table 10 wants their check ."
1559,"i’m proud of you , sheldon .",and a complete sucker .
2316,"no , i’m fine with it .","that sounds like sarcasm , but i’m going to disregard it , because i have an agenda . paintball . specifically , the interdepartmental tournament this weekend . now , in order to function better as a fighting unit , i thought we should establish a chain of command . now , it goes without saying that i would outrank the three of you , but the question remains , by how much ? now , i don’t see me as some four-star general , back at hq riding a desk and playing golf with the secretary of defence . but i also can’t be sergeant cooper , because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular joe . this might take some thought . as you were ."
9002,he came with a manual .,"question , how am i going to get leonard a present before the party ? i don’t drive , and the only things available within walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station . i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers ."
510,bite me !,please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes .
2036,so why are you trying to ruin it ?,"no , thanks . we’re fine . i mean , if you people want to eat at the table , then that’s what you should do . i like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things . but if those days are gone , they’re gone . it just makes me sad ."
6110,you were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me . you love me .,"yeah . tell me those arent the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain . amy , youre a neuroscientist . crack his skull open , spray some raid in there ."

8143,does yours have wet bweasts in it ?,"better . it has a gold crown . you see , the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged archimedes with coming up with the solution . because the crown was irregularly shaped , there was no way to mathematically determine its volume . but , while bathing , archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose ."
1354,"yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . look , look , look ! i started a business .","obviously , not a cleaning business ."
7773,why don’t you slip this on ?,said the hangman offering a noose .

1794,penny said she’s not sure she wants to be leonard’s girlfriend anymore .,wrong . she just took a sip from his diet dr . pepper .
6760,"ooh , look who’s out on a date . pasadena’s favourite power couple , shamy .","and that is the answer to the question , what is wrong with eating at the cheesecake factory ?"
7897,you can’t replace me with zack .,why not ? penny did it .
1501,what’s he doing here ?,"we’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen . and if that doesn’t work , i’m going to poison his tea ."
748,"you know , lets just come up with something new .","you know , a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction . the , the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c . clarke . the motorola flip phone , that came from star trek . and ive long suspected that the idea of an african-american president was stolen from the movie deep impact ."
4573,"okay , i didn’t know .",yes .
2955,here we go .,we don’t have thai food on thursday . we have pizza on thursday .
5190,what are you working on ?,can’t talk . in the zone .

2392,what heavy machinery ? lets just start .,"well , as a texas gentleman , im inclined to say ladies first . although , im concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins . perhaps we should flip a coin . or if youre familiar with the rules of rock , paper , scissors . . ."
9348,yes .,"how about your grandparents , they alive ?"
3465,"oh , sheldon , do you really think we’re gonna fight ?",my fists are not up here because i’m milking a giant invisible cow . they’re up to b*at an apology out of you .
3205,there’s no time for a crossbow . find me an icicle .,three months . this is gonna be great !
5884,"ah , youre upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didnt make a breakthrough , and now youre worried you made a huge mistake switching fields , and youre gonna sit around and sulk all day ?",like a big old baby .
5741,"for someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space , doctor who sure does have a thing for modern-day london .","careful , it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s who con ."

4377,i stand corrected .,"you know , italian housewives have a rule of thumb . a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked ."
8081,he said i’d be speaking to a class .,"no , i said you were teaching someone a lesson . now let’s go ."
9392,well the “check engine” light is fine . it’s still blinking away . it’s the stupid engine that stopped working . it cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it .,"you know , it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money ."
4684,"so , ive noticed leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with penny .","yes . if youd like to join in , the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure ."
664,"oh , better than north dakota ! i guess that joke’s only funny in nebraska .",from the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion . all you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here .
6935,i wouldn’t mind a glass .,i wasn’t talking to you .
8471,never mind . okay if i watch some tv ?,go ahead .
5998,do you have your own car ?,i don’t drive .

3688,aw . here’s what i think of your roommate agreement .,you pick that up right now .
7586,what could she possibly be talking about for so long ?,"obviously , waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity , that requires a great deal of analysis and planning . bazinga ! you know , using positive reinforcement techniques , i could train that behaviour out of her in a week ."
1962,yes ?,may i come in ?
1840,thanks .,"of course , i can’t mention you in my nobel acceptance speech , but when i get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote , and perhaps a signed copy ."
3894,but it would make the present so much nicer .,are you upset about something ?
7981,i think we’re all talking to penny here .,i’m not . no offence .

5802,"ah , interesting , were being accused of making you do things you dont like , and here you are , doing the same thing to poor amy .",you should point out the hypocrisy of that .
759,"guys , what are we doing ? we sent the girls away so we could focus .",i dont think it worked .

8026,and thats how its done .,"all right , weve defeated the first challenge . now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate ."
8106,"oh , sounds great .","oh , indians making tex-mex . might as well have had the chinese pizza ."
1437,"what , do you have eyes in the back of your head ?","when one gets b*at up every other day in school , one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing . incidentally , one can get b*at up in school simply by referring to oneself as one . i’m making english muffins . would you like an english muffin ?"

6332,i’m not going to punch you .,that’s what my sister used to say .
2906,"thank you . what did she mean , she’s happy for me ? is she happy because i’m seeing someone , or is she happy because she thinks that i’m happy , because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy , even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy . you know , because the second person , though happy , is now romantically unavailable to the first person .",do you realise i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call ?

6648,i’m sorry . why can’t you sleep ?,who knows ? i haven’t watched any scary movies recently . i’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe . and it’s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull .

5368,"here , i made you some strawberry quik .","i have real problems here , amy . i can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children . mmm , yummy ."

8443,yeah .,okay .
121,any other questions ?,"doctor sheldon cooper here , i am the lead author of this particular paper . thank you . and you , sir , you have completely skipped over the part where i was walking through the park , and i saw these children on a merry-go-round , which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero ."
2449,"yeah , thanks , but i kind of feel like eating alone tonight , so…","are you sure ? with your italian pizza and my chinese noodles , we could play marco polo . i mean , of course , a re-enactment of a meal in the life of marco polo the venetian explorer , not marco polo the terrifying water sport ."
3592,do you have any ideas ?,"yes , but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring ."
1566,"can you get the butter , please ?","you know , however , with the xbox one , i can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands . up until now , i’ve had to use leonard ."
1984,"no , thanks .","fine . good night to you , sir . miss ."
8879,what’s up ?,"it just occurred to me that i never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials . so i hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand . put ‘er there , you old so-and-so ."
9148,sorry .,were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali might have intercourse with penny tonight ?

8274,"no , it isn’t .","yes , it is ."
8360,"okay , okay , you know , i get it , leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college .",why would you lie about that ?
2333,"oh , hell with nebraska . i’m gonna be a star !",have you ever thought of teaching physics ?
573,"it’s not so bad , really . at least these trains have modern plumbing . in india , you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan .","he is referring , of course , to third class on indian railways’ magnificent ranakpur express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction ."
3307,what about that sweater ?,"no , its not good enough . it has to be perfect ."
8841,"no ! no ! no . let’s just all finish our dinners , okay ?",this is an interesting topic . how many sexual encounters have you had ?

1434,i’ll help you .,"thank you . lift with your knees , not your back . good night ."
6847,why would they lie to us ?,that’s a good question . amy and bernadette . amy and bernadette . amy and bernadette . why did you lie to us ?
2579,so what ? why do you even care ?,"oh , listen to them . not even married and the honeymoons over ."
9310,doesn’t matter .,"but , now , but in my defence…"
1867,come on . we said we were sorry .,it’s going to take more than i’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from penny to make up for what you’ve done to me .
1454,"okay , how about this . even spock had a date once every seven years .",he didn’t date . it was pon farr . his blood boiled with mating lust .
3852,yeah .,how ?
9658,its green .,"we did it . oh , if its this much fun to rotate , imagine when we fly it ."
6973,i gave it to him three days ago . he was really impressed . he wants to meet you .,"all right , then . thank you , howard . please let professor hawking know that i’m available at his earliest convenience ."

1820,"okay , what did amy tell you ?","oh , very well . i can’t keep up this clever charade any longer . she told me that you were thinking of ending it with leonard ."
6223,i don’t think we’re going to do that .,"well then apparently , you hate fun ."
2929,"no , it is not yours . we all went in on the box together .","well , yes , but i found it in the box , and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure ."
51,"sheldon , wake up .","danger , danger ."
4420,what ?,"i’ve been doing some research online , and apparently female primates , you know , uh , apes , chimpanzees , you , they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female . now , this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation . which brings me back to my question , where are you in . clearly , i’m 14 days too early ."
5405,"well , i was thinking about sheldonâ€™s little joke the other night about me eating all your food .","oh , that was no joke . but i understand your confusion as i am our groupâ€™s resident cut-up ."
5170,"no , of course not . how did you know about that ?","i did a comprehensive background check . medical records , credit reports , criminal history . i trust you paid off those parking tickets ."
469,hmm . youre up late .,"oh , im working on my lesson plan for wolowitz . he is going to be so lost . look at this section over here . even i dont really understand it ."
2629,aw .,my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead .
4902,why are you sitting in the stairwell ?,leonard told me to stay .
8395,how dare you . aishwarya rai is a goddess . by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute .,"sorry , i didn’t mean to offend you . obviously you’re not that familiar with indian cinema ."
4084,"no reason . oh , you know what , maybe this isn’t such a good idea .","oh , no , no , no , well now , there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening ."
9646,how would i be blinded ?,"at the end of the ceremony , all the students throw those pointy hats in the air . its all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye ."
8025,"um , uh , uh , uh , we dont have an appointment , and , and we dont belong here , but we , were , like , crazy-big fans . i mean . . . uh , buh , buh , ""crazy for star wars"" crazy , not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape , although we do have a backpack that you really dont want to look in .",youre blowing it . we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him .
1858,"aw , see , yeah , you probably shouldn’t have done that . so write another e-mail , set the record straight , it’s no big deal .","you’re right , leonard , it’s not a big deal . all you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university . that , fyi , was sarcasm . i , in fact , believe it is a big deal"
9289,and this is dr . g*n from stockholm .,"ah , sweden . yeah , home of my favourite muppet and , uh , second favourite meatball . okay , the nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded . boy , is his name g*n or no-funderson ?"
865,"i , i didn’t think it was a big deal .",it is to me; that’s the point .
9284,bernie…,"if it makes you feel any better , amy and i are fine . i mean , really good ."
6925,"something got you down there , bunky ?","howard , please , i’m begging you ."
6387,no .,i’m not surprised .
3615,"sheldon , we have to get out of here .",you might want to speak in a lower register .
7378,"oh , yes . he says they are lost without you .","well , we sure saw that coming ."
5912,"howards right , thatll never work .","stop fighting me on the premise . its scientifically valid . im going to advance propositions , i just want you to challenge me ."
5614,"oh , for god’s sake , sheldon .","focus is important . was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants ? did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser ? “thanks for discovering penicillin , now how about we try a bouffant ? ”"
425,"ah-wimoweh , ah-wimoweh…","bring it home , mufasa . eee , eee , eee , eee , eee , um , um-a-weh ."
188,"sheldon , at this point , i would go by myself before i would take you .",really ?
5323,im sorry . what was i thinking ?,"uh , just out of curiosity , why didnt you ask leonard for advice about this ?"
4130,what ?,"oh , of course , it only works on the weak-minded ."
228,thank you .,i reject them all .
3782,have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment ?,"hello , kripke . yes , sheldon cooper here . it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship . perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see . well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage . popular choices include tea , coffee , cocoa… i see . no , no , no , wait . don’t hang up yet . what about a recreational activity ? i bet we share some common interests . tell me an interest of yours . really ? on actual horses ? tell me another interest of yours . oh no , i’m sorry , i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to . tell me another interest of yours ."
3903,i’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell .,well is that really necessary . if you need money you can always sell blood . and semen .
2741,"okay , glasses off . find waldo .","hurry up , find him , find him ."
1041,"uh , i don’t know . could put a tennis ball on the end of excalibur . make a pretty badass cane .",do you supply the the tennis ball ?
8973,thats it . that wasnt so bad .,"no , it wasnt . uh , now lets tabulate the results of the experiment . i think its safe to say that youre not in love with me and im not in love with you . and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences ."
9266,i’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together .,"not as relieved as i’m about to be . it’s a brave new world , little lady ."
3941,i’ll take it .,"good . now , i assume we’re splitting the cheque ?"
471,"no , i mean , why are you going to so much trouble to prove that youre smarter than wolowitz ?","oh , its no trouble , its actually a pleasure ."
2921,who’s adam west ?,"who’s adam west ? leonard , what do the two of you talk about after the coitus ?"
1905,oh . that’s too bad . i wonder what happened .,"mm , it’s hard to say . i can only speculate based on the data i collected watching my parents’ marriage implode . in that case , the woman dives into religion , while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures . oop ! out of arrows ."
8644,oh… you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder ?,"is not . is not , is not ."
801,whats the big deal ?,"oh , of course its no big deal to you . you idolize me , and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on ."
1487,i wonder how long sheldon’s got .,these shrimp are all the same size . there’s no the logical order to eat them in .
8376,what ?,i said good day !
227,"yes , for you . i do , however , have a few conditions . first , at all times , i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal . second , my contributions shall be noted in all published material . and third , you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture .","i’m impressed , raj . those are very cogent and reasonable conditions ."
1128,is that why they sent you to boarding school ?,"no , that was the result of my work with lasers ."
4797,"wait , how can , how can anyone ruin raiders ? it’s perfect .","yeah , except for the fact that indiana jones is completely irrelevant to the story . with or without him , the n*zi find the ark , open it and die ."
6718,"sheldon , what if he gets his internet from his cable company ? he could lose his hbo and all their delightful original programming .","i don’t care ! i’m losin’ it , man !"
2208,"now that i’m actually about to go out with penny , i’m not excited , i’m nauseous .","ah , then your meal choice is appropriate . starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion ."
3964,"come on , sheldon . you and me right here .","penny , for the thousandth time , i’m saving myself for someone special . perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud ."
8846,"okay , you know what ? i’m gonna come at this in a whole new way . sheldon , if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish , i’m gonna tell your mother on you .",that’s no threat . my mother’s always wanted a grandchild .
3881,twice a month .,then no .
3153,to the north pole ?,yes .
5695,"come on , i touched one onion ring .","and then you put it back , compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings ."
8657,"oh , hey buddy .",buddy .
9353,"hey , did you ever make it to the dentist ?","not necessary . no . i found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning . mostly they cater to dogs , but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind ."
2144,"oh . all right , that’s cool , no biggie . he said he’d help me set up my printer , but i guess i can wait . what exactly is he doing up there ?","in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me , he is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo ."
7007,"not so loud , but ideally , yes . thanks .",thank you . and what is my function as wingman ?
5739,i will take that action .,"the flags of liechtenstein and haiti were identical by coincidence , a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 olympics . and thankfully , their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of fascism ."
3790,"you alwight there , cooper ?",not really . i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote .
2577,so do we . and ive seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things .,its called parallel play .
1632,what is that ?,"raiders of the lost ark , with 21 additional seconds . if i can’t see it , no one else can see it ."
8679,"that’s fascinating , but i…","i didn’t say it was fascinating , i said it was noteworthy ."
2298,no .,yes .
5944,"yeah , you get some sleep .","no , i dont want to go to sleep , you cant make me ."
156,is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?,"no , that seemed a little farfetched ."
7733,"how come if we’re the smart people , we don’t do this every night ?",what’s 16 times 14 ?
6349,it’s ridiculous .,says the former member of the corn queen’s court .
2879,"well , what do you think .","i said i could follow it , i didn’t say i cared ."
7243,"oh , wow .","oh , dear . i was afraid of this ."
3842,"there’s beer in the fridge . anyway , you guys really don’t need to make a big deal .","leonard , you’re being selfish . we need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face ."
4894,no . you’re on vacation .,please . what if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and i’m not there to see it ?
6135,"okay , well do it .",done .
6275,what .,ta-da . it’s short for da-da-da-da !
5211,but the chinese team found the element .,"yeah , well , they shouldn’t have . my calculations were wrong . there must be some resonance between the elements i didn’t know about ."
3279,i don’t know . where were we looking up at the night sky ?,greece .
7383,no ?,i was being sarcastic .
9202,priya’s going back to india .,irrelevant . rajesh and i have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it . what are you doing here ?
9170,"trust me . with your right hand , locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process .",all right .
2495,"i don’t know what succubus is , but it has suck in it , so that can’t be good .",thought i heard you out here .
8386,where are you gonna live ?,until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends .
2372,"okay , okay . guys , what are we doing here ?","i don’t know what you’re doing , but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with raj’s mother for a dollar ."
7401,"it’s actually ho , ho , ho , but you’ll get the hang of it . thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme .","fun ? mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly , the best-tasting jelly , and petroleum jelly , the worst-tasting jelly ."
5044,"yeah , honey , you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing , okay ?",penny . didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends ?
3902,"oh , leonard .",it’s still my turn .
7172,"yeah , and im not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship .","yeah , hes right . once , in a moment of candour , i told amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill . she stormed out . which was sad , because we were playing scrabble , and i had all the letters to spell persimmon ."
6784,"okay , i don’t think amy wants a pocket watch .","no , but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch ."
4789,aah ! it’s eating his face !,i found your webcam and replaced the video feed . you two should be ashamed of yourselves .
4766,what are you drawing over there ?,it’s a hypothetical containment field for a frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe .
5349,why ?,"he said it’s why they hired me , it’s , it’s what my grant was designated for , and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do . he then gave an example of something he had to do , even though he didn’t want to , which was look at my stupid face ."
4863,"hey , sheldon .",penny .
4123,"he’s probably busy . you’re worried about nothing . give it a couple more days . i’m sure he’ll play , and you’ll see that everything’s fine . my turn . i can’t let penny hand in a bad paper , but how do i tell her it’s bad without letting her know that i read it ?","hmm . b*at me . now , i know hawking’s not busy because i can see he’s playing other people right now ."
847,"no . come on , you’re supposed to say , of course he misses you , the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain .","oh , no , i don’t think that’s true at all ."
938,"sheldon , is it possible that your foul mood , or , to use the clinical term , bitchiness , is because your mother isn’t making you a priority ?","no . or to use the clinical term , nuh-uh ."
5502,"technically , faisal is my fiance . but i do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter .","well , that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your facebook page ."
4812,you’re trying to get back at me for what i said about raiders of the lost ark .,"that’s silly . almost as silly as dr . baker having a telephone , since telephones only existed in large cities at that time . this is more like little house on the preposterous ."
8652,"sheldon , just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean i have to participate .","all right , name your price ."
8385,that was fast .,it’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag . recommended by the department of homeland security . and sarah connor .
4161,"hang on , i think the emergency key is around here somewhere .",we have a bowl . our keys go in a bowl . you should get a bowl .

4030,"oh , dr . cooper , thank you . i’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work .","oh , no , no . that’s not going to happen , no . what i need you to do is find a valentine’s gift for my girlfriend ."

3651,"okay , okay . i’m gonna show you what’s in the box . but just promise not to flip out .",why would i flip out ? is it a spider ? it’s a spider .

4562,"relax , sheldon , he’s only a few minutes late .","professor proton was never late when he was on tv . you know , every day , four o’clock , he was there . unless tornadoes were ripping apart east texas , in which case we’d join him in progress . it’s him . hello . well , i see . yes . all right , we can come get you . yeah , well , see you soon . bye ."
3880,that sounds fair .,"hold on . bi-monthly is an ambiguous term , do you mean move it every other month , or twice a month ?"

7460,no .,yes .
4540,you said it .,theres no denying i have feelings for you that cant be explained in any other way . i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite . but that seems even more farfetched . the only conclusion was love . i know whats happening . this is a panic attack . soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated .
7495,that’s right . they’re no good without the lighter .,"well , so much for your advice on complimenting penny ."

3166,"now , honey , i already told you , the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature .",no . this is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole .

565,what are you doing ?,"i’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip . see , by attaching rfid tags to my clothing , it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand . i will then cross-reference them against destination , anticipated activity spectrum , weather conditions , duration of trip , et cetera ."
6058,okay .,"lets see . oh , this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous , disfigured freak ."
4800,mm-hmm . and ?,"and i think i’ve got it . consider , a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined , he causes nothing but problems . why do they keep him ?"

898,ugh . what are you doing here ?,"you told me not to call , and i didnt know how else to give you the good news . fun with flags is back , and you can be in the next episode ."
8806,probably not .,huh . it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me .
8210,not bad . i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would .,what exactly do you mean by that ?
8664,i guess that’s why they call you a genius .,"they call me a genius because i’m a genius . tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds , and that i’m having regular bowel movements . enjoy the wedding , goodbye ."
7028,"fine , it bothers me . you happy ?",you think youve got problems . the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape .

2595,"sheldon , what did you expect ?","i expected to see howard throw the baseball , finish my hot dog , and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickeys soundsational parade ."
6810,nothing rhymes with orange . it’s probably lonely .,"all right . come in . you look positively orange with loneliness . no , i don’t see that catching on at all ."
8528,thatâ€™s my boyfriend . itâ€™s open !,i got a splinter .
1030,aren’t you going to thank penny for taking you to disneyland ?,"thank you , penny ."
9602,"penny , have you seen my good inhaler ?","break it off , shake hands , walk away ."
6716,just say thank you .,i thought i just did .

5421,"yes , and to open it would destroy itâ€™s value . but remember , like me , you also have a human half .","well , iâ€™m not going to dignify that with a response ."
1755,"it’s not going to explode , just keep driving . warp speed ahead , mr . spock .","mr . spock did not pilot the enterprise . he was the science officer , and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprise’s check engine light blinking , he would pull the ship over immediately ."

231,all right .,"so , that’s what you wear to an interview ?"
7217,make this interesting ? you bet money on me ?,"no , no . we designed an experiment involving you . see ? now , isnt that interesting ?"
8422,"really ? thats the commitment issue youre wrestling with ? sheldon , do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed , while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch ?","ironys not really my strong suit . but i have been getting better with sarcasm , if you want to give that a try ."
5162,"yeah , that’s basically what i said .","yeah , the point is higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago , so that got me thinking , perhaps i’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my nobel prize ."
4064,i don’t know . olivia geiger ?,the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye ?
2514,"that’s interesting , but this could be taking you down the path toward a nobel prize . and in chemistry , no less . and wouldn’t that be unusual ? because you’re a physicist .","yes , yes , i’d be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry . everyone laugh at the circus freak . you know , i don’t need to sit here and take this , flatow . it is because of bullies like you , every day more and more americans are making the switch to television ."
4467,getting kind of grim .,"♪ then ill look from the door of my heavenly home , and pity the miner that mines my poor bones . ♪"
2917,well what did she mean by that ? was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention ?,you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy ? this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker . this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio .
8538,but it didn’t seem real .,"let me ask you a question . at any point , was las vegas on its side ?"
2992,"of course it is . it’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable , it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge . but returning to the original issue , dick grayson became nightwing , a superhero in his own right . batman 2 has to be the second robin , jason todd .",has to be ? has to be ? i hope you’re being deliberately provocative .
2317,what ?,"gentlemen , if i may interject , i’ve decided my rank will be captain . if it’s good enough for kirk , crunch and kangaroo , it’s good enough for me ."
4580,"no , i , i get that .","but , um , i did have you . and every day at four o’clock , you’d come to my house on channel 68 , and we’d do science together . if it hadn’t been for you , well , who knows what would’ve become of me ? you know ? instead of a world-class physicist , i could’ve wound up as a hobo . or a surgeon ."
9523,then what is it ?,i want a different question .
1515,"no . no , i’m not .","use the force , sheldon . use the force . i’m gonna need more force ."
216,i’m on it .,"that’s happy , right ?"
8976,i just want to make sure you get there safe .,"well , this is me . its been a very interesting evening ."
8827,"okay . uncomfortable silence it is . hey , sheldon , have you told amy what it was like for you growing up in texas ?",no .

8276,"mmm , no , it isn’t .","okay , then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car , bearing your license plates , coming to me ?"
5866,fine .,"needy baby , greedy baby indeed ."
893,"mm . i know how you feel . i spent the day throwing out a mans entire career , and all thats left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that raj took when he thought no one was looking .",its not the same thing . i dont think you know how i feel at all .

208,yeah let me start practicing for it . do you want fries with that maharaja mac ? ”,"hi , leonard . hello , raj ."
3254,‘cause i want to surprise him .,"can’t you surprise him in some other way ? for example , i’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment ."
2795,go away .,did leonard tell you to say that ?
3487,you guys comfy ? this might take a while .,i dont understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes .
798,have you not noticed that ive been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours ?,i just thought you were bad at the game .

6319,"sit down , we want to talk to you .",am i in trouble ? did my mother call you ?
8476,"sheldon , iâ€™m disappointed . as a brilliant man , youâ€™re entitled to a vice . i could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport . but this ? lame-o .","well , a , comic books employ storytelling through sequential art , a medium that dates back 17 , 000 years to the cave paintings of lascaux , and b , you play the harp . like thatâ€™s cool ."

6476,terrific . my-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup .,it wasn’t a breakup . a breakup would imply that amy was my girlfriend .

7501,okay . do whatever you want .,"yeah , but now , wait . do whatever i want ? or whatever i have to want ?"
7410,how did you know that ?,"it was simple . i combined a well-known historical fact about bohemia with the memory of my grandparents , mee-maw and pop-pop , singing christmas carols while i sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of legos ."
1097,"well , that , that clears that up .",you must be here to give me advice .
548,no !,"well , if he does , don’t believe it . he’s not above playing the dead meemaw card ."
6538,what’s his relationship status ?,"well , there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall . it ended as inexplicably as it began . they had very little in common , except for carnal activity . that’s why i acquired these noise-cancelling headphones . if you decide to use them , please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the wet wipes you’ll find in the bathroom . they’re in the drawer labelled wet wipes ."
4129,i quit .,"leonard , wait . no . i listened to your dumb thing . leonard , come back . leonard , come back . leonard , come back ."

3437,"buddy , i think amy might be upset .",why’s that ?
6452,oooh !,are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarke-maxwell or dirac ?

4076,"it doesn’t matter . the woman’s not interested in me , the woman rejected me .","okay , look , i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker . nevertheless , i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you . you did not ask her out ."
4692,we can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed . we should bring something .,i already am . i’m bringing the gift of knowledge .
9298,you know what ? i don’t have time for this . find another way home .,i’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me .

8564,"when we watch frosty the snowman , he roots for the sun .","excuse me , but the sun is essential for all life on earth . frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat . a crime , by the way , for which he is never brought to account ."

2919,why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff ?,"well , it’s very simple . in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose , i’m the smart one , wolowitz is the funny one , and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails . that leaves you , by default , as the muscle ."
1871,compwetely wecked .,"but i would like to remind you that in science , there’s no such thing as failure . there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career . that man’s name was , surprise , surprise , albert einstein ."
7870,who are you calling ?,the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe .
480,thats where im a little fuzzy .,"ha ! i knew it . all right . we have a lot of information to cover before your first test . which , by the way , is in eight minutes . the good news is im grading on a curve , so youre pretty much guaranteed a c ."
6464,"well , breakups , or whatever the hell this is , can be tough .","penny , i assure you , i’m fine . my relationship with amy was purely intellectual . there were no emotional bonds , the severing of which would cause me any discomfort . the relationship simply outlived its utility , and i’m continuing on with my life as before ."
9355,"ooh , sock mouth’s got him on the ropes .","i will admit nothing of the sort . and now if you’ll excuse me , i have to call my dentist and see if i can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped ."
2888,"wait , you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex ?","i didn’t have to , the dates just happened to coincide ."
6329,"okay , sheldon . i’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises . these methods come from the ancient gurus of india and have helped me overcome my own fears .","and yet , you can’t speak to women ."

4844,"yeah , but why are you doing it on the stairs ?","i’m a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase because leonard , get this , has a date ."
4469,"so , as hannah montana , miley was a world-famous pop star . but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl . which , i dont have to tell you , at that age , is its own headache .",thats preposterous . how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig ?
220,no .,"i assumed as much . but never fear . like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel , i have returned to save the day . odd , usually , he’s met by cheers . anyway , i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations , and it occurred to me that i could benefit…"
8951,youre all alike .,"well , what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling . like , i cant always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me . you know , like , uh , if theyre mad at something ive done or just in a bad mood . it , its incredibly stressful ."
1935,i wonder what changed her mind .,perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love .
344,"anyway , if it’s okay with you , we should talk about howard’s bachelor party .","well , seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation , but , what do you know , you’re half swan ."
3948,"wow , so , how long will you be gone ?","well , she’s due tomorrow . although it did take her six years to finish high school , so who knows ?"
7580,"yes , you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour .",very good . chocolate ?
8192,then maybe you should spank me harder .,maybe i will .
3717,"well , i don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth .","i suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying , angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair ."
5605,"great , great . did you walk the whole way ? it’s a little chilly .",koothrappali picked me up .
8713,"so , if any of you are considering going into experimental physics , my door is always open . once again , i’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out , but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach snapple into a helium neon laser . short answer is… don’t . and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is dr . sheldon cooper . dr . cooper ?",forget it .
4779,"well , yeah , but this isn’t just about looks . i’m , i’m way above average in a lot of other things .","not height , vision , athleticism , or ability to digest dairy products ."
5638,that was a good one .,it was so good .
9404,do i have to ?,of course . that’s how you move a conversation forward .
5799,"you were , but somehow i held myself back .",you know what you could make us do ? ice-skating . the cold air will trigger leonards asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a zamboni .
2391,yup . be right there . i assume you dont want wine .,correct . youre not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery .
7524,"seriously , i was talking to bernadette last night and she made some great points . you and i have known each other a long time , and i didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off .",very well . how do you propose we move forward ?

8861,you have a thing of paper clips right there .,"well , no , no , i need something more permanent to join these papers . say , don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer ?"
6027,"now , let’s talk about magnetic monopoles . can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is ?","of course . first , consider an ordinary magnet which has , as even the most uneducated in your audience must know , two poles , a north and south pole . if you cut that in half , you have two smaller magnets , each with its own north and south pole ."
7505,i’m sorry . that i asked .,"all right , let’s get this stupid play over with ."

2881,i’m sorry ?,"semiotics . the study of signs and symbols , it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics ."
1677,"all right , sheldon , this craziness has gone on long enough . please come home so i can cut your hair .","penny , you’re not trained . you’re not licensed . most importantly , you don’t have access to my haircut records ."

1964,"yes , we are . and we’re about to go to bed .",uh-huh .

4174,"where did that even come from , did he say we were ?","no , leonard said nothing , but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered ."
4262,"no , i’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar .","wise decision . you see , amy , success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height , strength , attractiveness , the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts , separately or together . leonard has none of these attributes , right , leonard ?"
648,"you know , there was a time when i was alone and had no friends . im starting to miss that .",he still hasnt responded . whats taking him so long ?
1370,yes .,and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do ?
9604,you’re really going to do this ?,"i am . yeah , penny pointed out that what i’m going through is essentially a breakup . and according to cosmopolitan magazine , one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship ."
9334,"i don’t know what that is , but if it means i can go home and sleep , then yes .","think carefully here . clause 209 suspends our friendship , and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials . our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent , utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall . ‘sup ?"

2181,"all i’m saying is , you know leonard the best .","not necessarily . i’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard . just the other day i discovered , he not only has a loofah , he hides it . why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah ? i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally , but i don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process . and until recently i had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance , he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that i maintain in the right concentration could be w*apon ."

9428,"no , the problem isn’t solved . he just blew us off .",i’ve got it . he didn’t remember me because the last time we met i was in a halloween costume .
3991,i need some guinea pigs .,"okay , there’s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try , but if your research is going to have human applications may i suggest white mice instead , their brain chemistry is far closer to ours ."
4584,"well , at , at this point , i’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs .","met my childhood hero , now i get to ride in an ambulance . boy , if we can get him to do that calendar , this’ll be the best day ever ."

5350,"that’s a rude thing to say , out loud .","it’s an outrage . honestly , i’m tempted to leave the university ."
1564,"forgive me for asking a stupid question , but why are you being stupid ?","i’m not being stupid . i’m employing the work of dutch researcher , mirjam tuk , who found that people with full bladders make better decisions ."
1782,"um , raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys .",excuse me . i didn’t authorize this .

904,"sheldon , she just got off the plane . she doesn’t want to cook .",of course she does . making me food is her way of saying i love you . making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying i really love you .
7036,"okay , just one question . what ?","my point is , pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism ive used many times . i did it the first time i went to see you in a play . you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience . oh , dont worry , he gave you seven thumbs up ."
9424,well ?,"they had a terrible time of it , leonard ."

9229,"sheldon , what’s going on ?","i read his research , and , it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine . which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as i had thought . it’s his mommy ."
2080,we’re going to long beach ?,"no , of course not , there’s no cousin leo , there’s no intervention , focus leonard ."

755,what ?,"unlike hot tub time machine , this couldnt be more simple . when biff gets the almanac in 1955 , the alternate future he creates isnt the one in which marty and doc brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015 . therefore , in the new timeline , marty and doc never brought the time machine…"
8118,"sheldon , are you all right ? when last we spoke , you were going to take a taxi home from raj’s , but according to facebook , you just checked in at the cheesecake factory .","yes , i was in a taxi , but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license , so i leapt out and ran for it ."

2118,"okay , honey , did you even know the people that are moving out ?","i never met them . that’s what made them perfect , there were no awkward hellos in the halls , there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors , they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell ."
9164,oh !,"oh , congratulations ."

5308,"yeah , absolutely . you need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities .",any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space . so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic .

8350,hi .,"oh , hi penny . fyi , the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only , and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so i’d avoid using that for your delicates ."
8565,"sheldon , what about you ? did you have a christmas tree ?","oh , yes . we had a tree , we had a manger , we had an inflatable santa claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn . and to make things even more jolly , there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures ."

4013,oh .,the resemblance is remarkable . i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair .

2095,"there is no leo , how can you say that ?","you didn’t read the bio , did you ? he’s not just a middle child , he’s the quintessential middle child , from a broken home to boot . psychologically speaking , the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab ."

7754,"what are you gonna do , sheldon , blow up the apartment ?","that was my first thought , but all my cool stuff is here ."
8541,i will . why are you making this such a big deal ?,"oh , oh , oh , i have a reason . it could be because you said yes to marrying zack , but every time leonard’s proposed , he’s gotten a resounding no . yeah , that’s just off the top of my head ."
6121,what are you doing ? its time to go .,im not going to work today . and would you like to know why ?

1892,bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard .,"i believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe . excuse me . dr . greene , question ?"
9085,because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes .,"this is not a sarape . this is a poncho . a sarape is open at the sides , a poncho is closed , this is a poncho , and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother ."

3193,it’s a blanket with sleeves .,"oh , that’s clever . let me see if i understand this correctly . her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable ?"
2890,"hmmm . good for him . good for leonard . okay , night .","no , no , wait , hold on ."
8278,no ! it wasn’t a betrayal . it was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license . i already have to buy my insurance from this place in the cayman islands .,but the only reason i was driving your car was because you were in distress and i was rescuing you .
2621,why do you even care ? just tell us what it says .,"control over the information contained in that letter belongs to howard . by happenstance , i came to know it . that doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely ."

9166,"it’s indeed admirable . although , it is microbiology .",your doctorate is in neurobiology . i fail to see the distinction .

2565,"no , and neither did our waiter .","well , if youre going to serve cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it ."

8914,"yes , and well get back to that . but , uh , even with your mother here , you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom . youre like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers .",do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning ?

6473,"cats , sheldon . you’re clearly upset about amy being gone , and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats .",clowder .
5057,no .,"the answer’s tricky . it’s second street . you see , you’d think it would be first street , but in most towns , first street eventually gets renamed to something else , you know , like main street , broad street , michigan avenue . leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that . we also play games . would you like to play one ?"

7058,"well , you can relax . just because you think i look pretty doesnt mean we have to spend the night together .",were you hoping we would because its prom ?
238,thank you .,alright ?
4015,"don’t be insulting rajesh . so , sheldon , tell me more about this princess you say i look like .","it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars , and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips ."
9025,"well , for one thing , we’re late for leonard’s birthday party . and for another , i told him to call security .","good luck . by the way , a six year-old could hack your computer system ."
2977,"all right . so , um , just give me a call .","so , leonard , how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday ?"
8952,really ? you always seem so confident .,"well , im not . and if i could read peoples minds , life would be so much simpler ."
9505,thanks for the heads up .,you’re welcome . one more thing .
945,"oh , sugarpie , you are burning up . we’ve got to get you to bed .",okay .
6073,"buddy , i , i get that youre worried about me and i , i appreciate that , but im not going to die .",you dont know that .
7265,whats going on ?,im mad at amy .
5097,you don’t need air bags .,what if a simulated van rear-ends me ?
6440,i’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone .,they can’t function without me . i’m the social glue that holds this little group together . you’re welcome .
5484,and who was that ?,"you , you dirty birdie . i-i thought about the things you said to me yesterday , and i realized i’m deeply offended . now , be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms ."
3552,"yeah , good for you . now , start counting .",you know what this place needs ? a suggestion box .
9714,"ugh , toby , what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now ?",his name isn’t toby . toby is an absurd name for a cricket .
3360,its not your fault .,is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically ?
8711,what’s the difference ?,what’s the difference ?
2410,"well , now i wish i had the ability to make that stuff easier for you .",thank you .
4507,"fine , it bothers me . you happy ?",you think youve got problems . the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape .
8241,"""upon review , ive changed my mind about the cooper-hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid . in fact , its inspired me to come up with my own theory . maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket , much like cooper and hofstadter . """,can i respond now ?
3982,and over here is sheldon .,hi .
146,"sheldon , i’m not taking you to switzerland .","well , of course you are . who else would you take ?"
6296,"as long as we’re apologising , sheldon , i , i’m sorry i used your toothbrush .",and i’m sorry . but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated . we are no longer friends .
2294,here’s your cocoa .,"oh , half and half instead of whole milk ?"
2253,"yeah . that’s why i’m going to skip over it . are you saying that amy is , oh , what’s the",forget science . she’s horny .
3611,sheldon !,sssshhhh ! penny’s sleeping .
1736,one was already in an accident .,"that doesn’t mean one won’t be in another , especially if i’m driving ."
5544,"so , i did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines , and the guys might be right , sounds pretty rough down there . for starters , its very humid , and about a hundred degrees .","well , im from texas and youre from india , were no strangers to the fragrant armpit . next ."
7244,what ?,"while a thoughtful gift , this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars ."
114,"okay , i’m leaving for the conference .",have fun presenting my lucky hunch .
8630,yello .,you need to remove that chair from the building . it’s a health hazard .
7262,"sheldon , were all scientists . i helped out a fellow colleague . youre being petty .","im being petty ? you know barry and i have a professional rivalry . you heard him , he told me to suck eggs . if we were friends , he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant . why are you laughing ? did you learn something ?"
9231,how’s that ?,i feel like i’m being strangled by a boa constrictor . why’d you stop ?
498,are you saying he’s man-struating ?,"not literally . but as far back as the 17th century , scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels ."
7095,"i’m warning you , sheldon !","your threats are empty , nothing can move me . stop that ."
720,what ?,my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick .
6795,"okay , see you later .",good news . i finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess .
8613,you video-chat with amy all the time . how is this different ?,don’t you like amy ?
5418,i need to speak with you .,fascinating . the only logical explanation is that this is a dream .
3089,"hey , sheldon , im sorry .","no , its fine . now i can devote all my time to dark matter ."
6836,what can we do that’s free ?,"oh , got it . we order a pizza ."
6908,"you suck , wolowitz !",he makes a valid point .
6160,"sheldon , we are just people . we talk about the same things you guys talk about .","you talk about if werewolves can swim ? see , leonard says yes , but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten . what do you think ?"
596,"i see . well , it seems once again , you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place .","oh , i hate when that happens ."
8858,oh . yeah . that’s gone . it’s a rough month when halloween and pms hit at the same time .,"leonard doesn’t have time to chat , he has to get the mail ."
5766,are you okay ?,"oh , im fine . why did you come ?"
5164,"so , you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff ?","that’s a good point . my time is much too valuable . you know , perhaps i should find someone to do it for me . you know , someone with a rudimentary understanding of science , but whose real talents lie in menial labour ."
1647,so my kid said the funniest thing today .,nope .
9071,"okay , i’m not talking about this with you .","oh , penny , this is a natural human process , and we’re talking about statistically significant savings . now , if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle , are you fairly regular ? okay , no warehouse store , but we’re still on for put-put golf , right ?"
6550,good .,"wonderful . meaningless pleasantries accomplished . elizabeth , leonard’s bathroom time is coming up , and believe me , you do not want to follow him ."
2700,"oh , he’s a sweetie .","yes . it’s very sweet . now , slowly and carefully , flush him down the toilet ."
7020,my incredible hulk hands signed by stan lee .,"oh , my . i’ve admired these for years ."
1700,great .,"on the bright side , that oxford study was right . one friend down . i wonder who youre going to lose next ."
8710,well yeah .,i’m a theoretical physicist .
6829,"oh , oh , beekeeper to king 12 . i capture your pope and release the swarm . checkmate on sheldon .",i knew i should have given my pope the jet pack .
5610,here we go .,"that is my desk chair , that is where i work . i don’t eat in my desk chair and i don’t work in my spot . i work in my desk chair and eat in my spot ."
2942,why don’t we go after your mother ?,"go ahead . i have no illusions about my mother . she is a kind , loving , religiously fanatical right-wing texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild dr . pepper addiction . anything you’d like to add ?"
5960,"here , you want my peas ?","peas ! perfect , they can be electrons ."
86,"sheldon , why is this letter in the trash ?","well , there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter , but occam’s razor would suggest that someone threw it out ."
2308,"no , you’re done . i want you out of my apartment right now .","well said , boy wonder ."
2677,what the hell is going on ?,"there’s a bird outside the window , and he won’t go away . that is the hell that is going on . we have no worms or seeds here . shoo , shoo ."
7798,she’s good .,i know . and it gets worse . her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times .
7310,we’re gonna write an application…,"the prairie sky is wide and high , deep in the heart…"
2594,"this is fun , huh ? we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch , have a hot dog , watch the game .",whoa . nobody said anything about watching the game .
5564,getting kind of grim .,"♪ then ill look from the door of my heavenly home , and pity the miner that mines my poor bones . ♪"
1029,"no , you already threw up once . go put on your pjs and brush your teeth .","okay , but just don’t fight"
136,excuse me . is there anything you’d like to apologise for ?,yes . i’m sorry i tried to blow up your head . it was uncalled for .
6465,okay . good .,"now , if you’ll excuse me , i’m off to buy a pussycat ."
8159,"yeah , so ?","i can think of many things spider-man can’t do that a spider can . one , crawl in your ear and die . two , legally leave guatemala without a passport . three , have sex with a spider ."
2854,seriously ? you don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush .,my plan is to stop at malls and buy what i need . it’s called living off the land .
4409,we never got to the bedroom .,because ?
1200,oh . we’re scientists .,tell him about our iq .
4717,go to your room .,but i’m a professional scientist .
9722,don’t knock . just walk in . why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle ?,"excuse me , are you professor crawley ?"
6243,we’re going to have to be very quiet .,"i know how to get the bucket ! i can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it . let’s see . go north . you are in a forest . go north . you are in a forest . go north . you are in a forest . oh dear , i believe i’m lost . well , i’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow ."
566,"well , that does sound much simpler . how long is this going to take ?","assuming i can keep up this pace , three hours , 11 minutes , and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation ."
6871,im heckling you . its a beloved part of baseball .,"hes right . and given that youre probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade , im sure you do suck ."
3927,"sheldon , are you sure you want to be bringing raj on your date night with amy ?","oh , absolutely . i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation and casual physical contact , but nowhere is it specified that i can’t outsource that to an indian ."
5729,cool . i think i just learned something .,did you have fun doing it ?
7178,"interesting . can you see how a grown man , an accomplished scientist , who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources ?",no .
7502,"oh , for god’s sake , just come to the play .","all right . i don’t want to , but at least that makes sense ."
6946,hey .,hello .
7434,"oh , you’re so arrogant . if you were a superhero , your name would be captain arrogant . and you know what your superpower would be ? arrogance .","you’re wrong again . if my superpower were arrogance , my name would be dr . arroganto ."
8681,"that’s great , but i… .",what i’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis .
9672,su1c1de .,wrong . obesity .
2330,let’s get ‘em !,"if there’s ever a church of sheldon , this will be when it started . ow !"
3515,"sheldon , that really is an excellent basket .",its not a basket . its a soldiers helmet from 16th century china .
2187,"alright , why don’t you just pick one at random , and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time .","no , no , that’s crazy . you go ahead and talk while i figure it out ."
195,yes .,heated to 180 degrees ?
6866,"all right , why don’t we begin ? your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with .",that’s an easy guess . i’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders .
5360,that’s very sweet . but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you .,i don’t understand . how could we all live together if i’m not there ?
5059,how about we just have a little quiet time now ?,"all right . hmm , huh , i’m sorry , i’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling ."
802,just tell her .,i called leonard because i failed . and i didnt want you to think less of me .
8724,"well , it doesn’t have to be coffee . how about dinner ?",i do eat dinner .
7465,no . it’s too brobdingnagian .,why do you even want this here ? its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose .
2068,i remember symposium .,"yes , well , he lied ."
7162,"ooh , what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up ?","nice . you mean , like at parks and schools ?"
8517,iâ€™m listening .,"with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever , physical or otherwise , i would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend ."
644,do it .,"you mess with the bull , you get the horns . im about to show this guy just how horny i can be ."
9136,sheldon ?,"i can make it , but i won’t ."
5103,so what is it you’re doing ?,i’m transcending the situation . i’m clearly too evolved for driving .
8045,you did flop around a lot .,ill take your word for it . i was too busy trying not to defecate .
120,bye sheldon .,"goodbye penny . oooh , one of these days , pkshhhh !"
2981,"sure , why not ?","then , this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section ."
5069,i have a better idea .,you want to go to pottery barn first ?
3074,"you mean the dialogue that went , please , no , please , no , please , no .","thats the one . i believe you went last , so , uh , please ?"
8694,"sheldon , you are really being unreasonable .",am i ? here . eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister .
3278,not that far back !,okay ! at what point did you begin to feel lost ?
2135,yes ?,welcome to the building .
6003,"you just , you just walked in and they hired you , just like that ?","oh , heavens , no . since i don’t need to be paid , i didn’t need to be hired . i simply came in , picked up a tray , and started working for the man . let me get that plate out of your way ."
4970,"okay , cat on a hot tin roof is an american classic .","so is the mcrib sandwich . i don’t care for that , either ."
8770,"sheldon , what are you doing out of bed ?",now ! do it !
134,you’re lucky i didn’t run you over .,"i really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about , you begged me to come , i came , there’s just no pleasing you ."
8091,"okay , i’m out of here .","un momento . oh , for heaven’s sake , now you’re being deliberately stupid . where are you going ?"
9394,"wow , you got a lot of money in there .",that’s why it’s guarded by snakes . take some .
5826,"sheldon , i , im sorry if i hurt your feelings . ive been holding a lot of this in for a while .","well , im sorry , too . and if you want to live with penny , then i think you should ."
2559,"you know , i’d really like to hear it from dr . hofstadter , if it’s okay with you .",what a surprise . did you invite me back just so you could ignore me ?
62,22 .,right . 22 .
1358,i don’t know .,and you’re going to let her handle my food ?
5508,"hello , mrs . latham . yes , i live with him . i don’t , i , i really don’t know why . tonight ? sure , that’d be great . okay , i’ll , i’ll see you then . bye . she wants to have dinner and talk about my research .","an entire dinner to talk about your research ? where you going , the drive-thru at jack in the box ?"
2467,you’re being ridiculous .,"amy , there were chinese food containers in the trash can ."
679,what for ?,i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down .
6433,is he always like this when he loses ?,"oh , yes . you should’ve been here for the great jenga tantrum of 2008 ."
741,"for your information , emily is working tonight .","yeah , one would assume , on getting out of the pit ."
5307,are you kidding ? yes . what did you have in mind ?,"ill tell you exactly what you should do , avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm ."
6384,see that ? i just saved us forty bucks .,"i’ve long said , what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts ."
3641,"hey guys , i got this .","hang on penny . how about fans , here and here ?"
7914,"oh , great . no superman , no wonder woman ? all we’ve got is a skinny flash , an indian aquaman , a nearsighted green lantern , and a teeny , tiny dark knight .","obviously , we’re no longer a justice league . we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes ."
7700,"sheldon , i’m not alone in here .",what ?
3258,"yeah , actually , it was pretty cool . a lot of the girls threw up , but i gutted that thing like a deer .","i’m sorry , penny , i don’t think so ."
4663,thank you .,"no , thank you . delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nations commerce . its because of people like you , people like me can limit our human contact . id shake your hand , but , well , you know ."
1873,"here you go , shelly .","thanks , mom ."
6025,"thank you , sheldon .","now , whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is , of course , an entirely different question ."

1717,and snacks .,"well , i guess it was too good to be true ."
2912,no kidding .,"i won’t go out on a limb , but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger ."
2843,i was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire .,and you couldn’t put it out ?
4027,hold on . what happened with you and lalita ?,"we ate . she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks , nothing i didn’t already know , and i came home ."
8409,why not .,i promised penny .
7602,morning .,"look , leonard , penny made french toast ."
7737,make yourself comfortable .,thank you . is someone smoking ?
489,you reported me to human resources ?,you violated the sanctity of my mouth .
493,"yeah . okay , how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer ?",laminate the core material .
690,drink whatever you want .,i want soup .
3821,wouldn’t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else ?,can’t happen . we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me .
602,"he’s calling to ask you a favour . you might be confused because he didn’t use the words , penny , sheldon , please or favour .","okay . enough chitchat . okay , step one , locate your emergency key to our apartment . step two , enter our apartment . step three , enter my bedroom ."
1911,fascinating work . i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes .,have you learned anything ?
7968,because i’m frodo .,"yes , well , i’m the doppler effect ."
6555,"oh , no , no , it’s okay . you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant .","i must say , i’m shocked by this betrayal ."
1993,"sheldon , that’s so…",you might want to lock the door behind me . this isn’t bozeman .
7951,"no thanks , peanuts , i can’t afford to swell up in these tights .","i’m confused . if there’s no costume parade , what are we doing here ?"
3757,"come on ! there’s over 200 questions . and look at some of these things . sheldon is to camaraderie , as the space shuttle is to blank ?","there are a number of acceptable answers , for example , c"
2366,she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause .,"well , that’s a fine how-do-you-do . don’t just stand there . take your breasts out ."
5283,whatcha doin’ ?,i’m reverse engineering wolowitz’s magic trick .
4370,"well , what about me ?",the statement stands for itself .
6516,when can i sit with you again ?,"when i’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart . you know the drill . all right , if you’ll excuse me , i am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics ."
8347,"well , we sort of decided to wing it .","oh , even i know that’s lame ."
1361,"so , what do you think ? i mean , this could be a business , right ?",how many of these can you make a day ?
5660,congratulations .,lets celebrate .
1526,"what , you don’t like wind chimes ?","no , i hate them , but it gets worse . there it is ."
8072,she sounds like a keeper .,"anyway , i wanted to apologize . i am truly sorry ."
5753,"um , let me just have some coffee first , and then ill have the strength to tell you how much i wont be doing that . hello ?","hello , leonard ."
9270,please let me be there when you tell her that .,why ? so you can see the look on amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea ?
1551,exactly . how does that make you feel ?,the same way any normal person would . i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldon-face confetti .
6225,did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands ?,abundantly .
9441,sorry .,sorry wonâ€™t bring their kites down . ow ! string burn ! string burn !
1337,nerds !,i hate this planet .
3901,those are movies .,well of course they’re movies . were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine ? that’s absurd .
3010,thank you .,i believe it was your turn in the game .
5041,"sheldon , what is it ?",leonard’s asleep .
8595,"thank you , that’s very comforting .",that’s not the comforting part .
2250,so how’s amy ?,amy’s changed . i might have to let her go .
6504,"oh , come on . i don’t want to sit by myself .","that’s what typhoid mary said , and clearly , her friends buckled ."
5039,you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords ?,"i didn’t try , i succeeded . for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to de-bus ."
2346,i’m a what ?,"i’m not sure , it could go either way ."
9044,"you know , i’m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back .","i don’t want my job back . i’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations . before that i spent four years working on my thesis . before that i was in college , and before that , i was in the fifth grade . this is my first day off in decades , and i’m going to savour it ."
2784,"okay , sheldon , i understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis , you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully .",alright .
5119,"hello . hey , howard . what’s wrong ? okay . okay , we’ll be right there .",what happened ?
7139,"well , as long as were suspending the parameters , i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover .",thats a big step .
6323,"oh . i say a lot of things , sweetie . so , how about it , sheldon ?","i don’t know . if you’re my x-men , what are your powers ?"
150,"yeah , well , i’ve been dreaming about spending valentine’s day with a girl since i was six .",shame on you ! that’s no dream for a scientist !
2804,"okay , well , um , speaking of spreads , we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for mr kim , who’s agreed to join us here at the university .","of course he has , the oracle told us little neo was the one . you can see the matrix , can’t you ."
5554,"or totally naked . i love howard , but the dude needs a little shame .","all right , amy , this walkie-talkie is yours . if we run into any problems , ill contact you . and if anything bad happens , whats the rule ?"
2086,okay . so what’s up ?,"well , uh , penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent , which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium , given by dr emile farminfarmian ."
3751,"okay , question 1 . rank the following aspects of sheldon cooper in order of appeal . intelligence . ruthless attention to hygiene . playfulness . java applet writing ?","i know , i may have started off with a fairly obvious one . you did an aspect of my most appealing trait , playfulness . why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1 . i’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest . it should take you no more than 3 hours ."
2259,i’m sure it’ll wash off .,little comfort tonight . i look like a hell’s angel .
4017,if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath .,i’m not hitting on her .
7249,sheldon ! i told you no klingon .,"fine , i’ll do it in english , but it loses something . the need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me . maybe because i’m so interesting all by myself . with that being said , may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own . the klingon would have made you cry ."
5731,sweet !,why are you waving a white flag ?
2424,"aw , sweetie , im comfortable around you , too .","of course you are , im warm and soothing . im like a human bowl of tomato soup ."
7599,are you fun in any of them ?,the math would suggest that in a few i’m a clown made of candy . but i don’t dance .
3856,it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard .,thank you .
859,"okay , look , here’s something people do not know about me . when i first moved out to l . a . , i did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a k*ll gorilla . ugh ! after i did it , i felt so ashamed . thankfully , that thing never came out .",i’ve seen that . yeah . serial apeist . howard found it online the day we met you .
7727,really ?,i don’t see why that’s surprising . i excel at so many things . you’ve had my sourdough bread .
7180,i know . i was looking forward to it .,"it wouldve been so nice to have a place that was ours , where we could just sit and read comics in peace ."
7659,"sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry .","in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics , i need to change my diet ."
6922,it was great . we talked about movies .,oh !
8339,"wait , hang on . doubles . roll again .","okay , get this . it doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts , because the koothrappalis are vastly wealthy ."
4739,"here comes santa claus , here comes santa claus , right down santa claus lane . vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins .","yeah , i appreciate the ride ."
8370,hey .,hi penny .

8112,"oh . hey , sheldon . what can i get ya ?",water . neat . with a little umbrella .
1779,"you’re out of your mind , sheldon .",that’s a negative . my mother had me tested . over .

5497,really ? what do we tell siebert ?,tell him dr . cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of god .
8592,that’s a lousy conversation starter .,"oh , is it ? we’re conversing . checkmate ."
1006,"well , maybe that’s ’cause leonard can’t cook .",you can’t cook and you made me this .
8078,you’re annoying .,"well , that really hurt ."

3875,"you’re joking , right ?","oh , i never joke when it comes to vertigo ."
7697,"i can’t hear you , i’m in the shower .",i have to skip the chitchat . emergency .
1752,could you please drive a little faster ?,"oh , i think we’re going sufficiently fast . what’s that ?"
5310,"yeah , i kind of want to do it again .","i dont recommend it . youll be doing it the rest of your life . anyway , if youre looking for leonard , hes with koothrappali ."
6597,sheldon ! what did you do ? !,"i know ! it’s not enough , is it ? here ."
2916,"really , oh yay !",who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table ?
7845,"i do not , my mother lives with me .","well then , it’s all settled , christie will stay with howard , penny can go back to her apartment , and i’ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who , although at this point it’s more like doctor why bother ."
152,my rabe-what-ly ?,"rabeliechtli . it means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals . which you will not be celebrating because , a , these festivals occur in the fall , and b , you will not be going to switzerland ."

3907,he offered me a fair price for the whole collection .,"what’s the number , i’ll match it ."
8900,"oh , you mean this son . uh , sure , hes terrific .","beverly , would you like to see the math i worked out to support our hypothesis ?"
2552,"sheldon , it’s a beautiful night . why don’t you and i go for a nice walk together ?","oh , everything is just sex with you isn’t it ?"
2773,you can’t let this kid get to you . you always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter .,"yes , but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years , and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg ."
5769,how were they ?,"oh , i have no idea . i never left the train station ."
3551,i’m sure it was .,i intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter .

7321,"sheldon , you’re not in charge . it’s my idea . i’m in charge .","oh , of course you are . look at the organizational chart . you’re clearly listed as founder ."
309,"yup , there’s no inflammation at all , sheldon .",then it must be a tumour .
7301,"if you want , i can yell at you later .",it wont be as good .
8605,"fine , whatever . priya will be having breakfast .","all right , so technically it’s not a dinner date . i suppose you could call it a , uh , dinfast date . but if you did , you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking , such as , hey , leonard , how was your dinfast with priya last night ?"
6916,jews don’t have heaven .,then to avoid jewish hell ?
3599,so penny’s a little messy .,"a little messy ? the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy , this is chaos . excuse me , explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid . i’m just inferring that this is a couch , because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale ."
3622,you think ?,"granted , my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox , but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny’s quality of life ."
3811,"it only gets funnier when you explain it , sheldon .",i know .

205,"what do you mean , he’s getting deported ?","i believe it means that the u . s . government is going to expel him from the country . he could then either return to his native india , emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him , or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate . personally , i’d choose pirate ."
9590,"no , but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything .",why would you do that ? you’re a string theorist as well .
1135,bye .,bye .
9480,then we can be the bengal tigers .,"poor choice . gram for gram , no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant ."
2749,"sheldon , we haven’t won a game all night . now , you either stick your face in that pie or i’m gonna stick that pie in your face .",that’s rude .
3613,"do you realise that if penny wakes up , there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here ?",i just gave you a reasonable explanation .
305,"i call my mee-maw nana . and she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock k*ll your enchanted bunny . game over , moon pie .",i… i… i don’t understand . your grandmother’s alive ?
1849,"actually , it was his idea .",of course it was . the whole plan reeks of leonard .
6100,really ? you wont even say a ?,you bet your sweet b i wont .
1988,"oh , no , he’s going to telecommute . everybody’s really excited about it .","all right . boone , north carolina . every summer since 1952 , boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake , dan’l boone . sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd . penny , you’re from nebraska , correct ?"
3240,"oh , come on , it’s fine . we’ll just put it all on the table , you know , family style .","oh , sure . and while we’re at it , why don’t we put our hands behind our backs , have an old-fashioned eating contest ?"
2798,"no , i just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did .","oh , good , you’re all here . look , i’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me , we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade , twelve years tops . go away ? hmm . could it be me ?"
4515,"okay , just one question . what ?","my point is , pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism ive used many times . i did it the first time i went to see you in a play . you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience . oh , dont worry , he gave you seven thumbs up ."
5630,"sheldon , penny was our only hope .","i’m sorry , leonard . but revenge is a dish best served cold ."
7295,thats not true .,that sounds like us . i still dont understand why youre upset . you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps .
3109,"before we do , i just talked to leonard . and if youre gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard , then im out . but if youre interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher , then im willing to give this a sh*t .",i suppose thats a fair request . theres no reason we both cant benefit from this experience .
4939,"fair enough , but in its essence , teaching is a performance art . in the classroom paradigm , the teacher has the responsibility to communicate , as well as entertain and engage .",i sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany . would you mind very much jumping to it ?
4059,"you betrayed us for money , who are you ?","i’m a rogue knight elf , don’t you people read character descriptions ? wait , wait , wait , somebody just clicked “buy it now . ”"
1987,"come on , sheldon , you can’t move . don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns ?","oh , if that were only true . unfortunately , as i’m earthbound for the foreseeable future , i need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena . like enid , oklahoma . low crime rate and high-speed internet connectivity , but no model train shops . sorry , enid ."
8706,any news you want me to pass along to mom ?,"well , she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory ."
383,"no , forget it . i take it back . offer’s off the table .",who’s in the mood to laugh ?
5634,i know i was thinking that . is this a show on flags or mind reading ?,"but the truth is i can no longer balance a full-time career , a popular internet show , and a girlfriend ."
4307,"my friend , justin .","pay attention , leonard . that’s why she can’t play on sunday ."
3388,"well , her torso is . just kidding . i put her in a wood chipper .","oh , dear lord . oh , dear lord ."
3156,"we’re not really gonna go to the north pole with him , are we ?",i’m still within earshot ! you may want to wait for my door to close .
2727,yep !,"wait , no , no . no . the word is polish . see , look . polish sausage . and the , the model of the solar system developed by nicolaus copernicus , a polish astronomer . and then , finally , if that wasn’t enough , which it should have been , this is madame curie k*ll herself by discovering radium , who , although she was a naturalized french citizen , was polish by birth ."
5992,no .,you didn’t really type .
5939,"its one thing to make yourself miserable , but youre making everyone around you miserable , too . now , im telling you for the last time , take the cap off .","oh , really ? what if i dont ? and before you answer that , can i have my dessert ?"
8459,"okay , well , this isnt easy to say , because i love you , but i need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation .",oh .
7977,no . i’m going to assert my dominance face to face .,"face to face ? are you going to wait for him to sit down , or are you going to stand on a coffee table ?"
5711,sheldon sheldon sheldon .,yes ?
3832,"i’d love that , but she’s not really comfortable around people .","yeah , i used to be uncomfortable around people , but then i learned a trick . i pretend everyone i meet is a beloved character from star trek ."
8480,you know what ? never mind . iâ€™m going to tell him itâ€™s okay to ask her out .,"the question is moot . there is no way that stuart , an impoverished peddler of picture books , would be at all appealing to amy farrah fowler , a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia ."
4776,"it’s not a big deal . he’s just in her history class . they’re working on a project together . i don’t even know why i care . you know what , i don’t care .",you think you don’t care ?
4276,that is insane .,you’re right . it would never work . amy finds you tedious .
253,you are not my superior .,i am in every way .

9345,ninth ?,"you moved up one . my pen pal in somalia was kidnapped by pirates . so , uh , how are you ?"
7704,proceed .,"very well . count the first , on or about the 28th day of april , the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency , to wit , my back teeth were floating . count the second , the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower , to wit , one , unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens ."
278,"all right , i won’t set one aside for you .",but i must have it .
3252,"thanks , raj . okay , so here’s the thing , i was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics ?","a little physics ? there’s no such thing . physics encompasses the entire universe , from quantum particles to supernovas , from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies ."
2480,"come on , i said i was sorry .","no , no , you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with penny ."
289,"you know you keep quoting wrath of khan , but he was in next generation . it’s a totally different set of characters .",silence ! how much longer must i wait for my revenge ?
8122,what you doing ?,i’m setting out snacks .
3075,"dr . cooper , while you were away , we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study .","wow . pouting and running away actually worked . i must say , that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me . so , um , what is the solution ?"
8850,"sheldon , sheldon .","hmm . all right , all right . i see what’s going on . a little pre-halloween hijinkery . a ghostly moan , a rattling of chains , a witch’s cackle . the trifecta of haunted house clichés . instead of eek , i say yawn ."
7202,"well , you could shove them somewhere .","okay , now youre getting creative ."
6061,"if it helps you sleep , then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman ?","really leonard . insults ? after i spent two hours in your closet , waiting for you to fall asleep ?"
5089,next !,aced it .
8087,"and , what did you think ?","well , first , i think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing ."
9471,"oh , i guess so .","good . oh , fyi . after i eat my sandwich , iâ€™m taking koothrappaliâ€™s patang kite out for a test run . would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me ?"
8176,maybe we should start with that .,"now you’re being a responsible patient . now , you may notice some tingling ."
5790,i cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station .,"i know . you know , i almost died in a fire in des moines , but i stayed put . fyi , thats when the imodium gave out ."
7333,no .,"well , but hear me out . the atomic b*mb was the manhattan project . windows 95 was originally project chicago . for our app , i would humbly suggest project nodlehs ."
270,but you have a whole bunch of ‘em .,"yes , i’ve moved to a four-napkin system . lap , hands , face and personal emergencies . if you like , starting tomorrow , i’ll add a guest napkin , but i’m afraid there’s nothing i can do for you today . good luck . that’s the face napkin ."
4570,"you know , i’m a real scientist . i , i have a phd from cornell university .","yeah , that’s great . did you bring your puppet ?"
7436,what’s up ?,nothing . i just wanted to make raj stop talking .

3218,are you usually radioactive when found in nature ?,no .
1391,"hey , we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab .","oh , great . raj , why don’t you and howard go get the charcoal ? leonard , why don’t you start working on some preliminary web site designs . i’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process ."
3975,did you miss me ?,i would’ve preferred to have you there with me .
4316,"no , we just had a little spat .","look on the bright side . as the result of penny’s forfeit , you have become the world’s first winner of research lab . would you like a commemorative snow cone ?"
6340,you own the damn thing . just take a freaking sweater !,"look , i didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly ."
8079,"i’m sorry , dr . jeffries , i’m just excited . this nano vacuum tube idea of yours is , it’s really interesting .","hello , leonard . oh , hello , arthur . what an odd coincidence that you’re both here ."

83,because we can .,they found the remote controlled cars .
873,you said you werent gonna bring that up .,"and you said you pressed record . anyway , please sit back , relax , and join us as we take our final lap , as indicated by the waving of this racing flag . and , of course , white flags can also represent surrender , the stewards of gondor , and the japanese minamoto clan , but im sure you remember that from episode sixty-two , white flags , whos wavin ‘em and why ?"
9360,"you call that a glow stick ? that is a glow stick . come on , let’s go .","before you go , consider this . not only do i have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system , i also have all 61 episodes of the bbc series red dwarf and fiddle-faddle . all yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement ."
7223,i just saw you .,hang on .
4557,"sheldon , you know that if you stay up all night , you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow . and a sleepy sheldon is a cranky sheldon . and a cranky sheldon is actually no different than a regular sheldon . good night .",i’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo .

4647,yeah ?,r2-d2 and c-3po . dibs on threepio .
2038,"see , the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet , and skynet was developed by miles dyson , but that future no longer exists , due to dyson’s death in terminator 2 .","okay , then riddle me this . assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor , why would skynet , an artificial computer intelligence , bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old k*ll robot ?"
9448,"sheldon , how do you know this stuff ?","i grew up in texas . football is ubiquitous in texas . pro football , college football , high school football , peewee football , in fact , every form of football except the original , european football , which most texans believe to be a commie plot ."

7713,"a good question , howard . turns out you can’t . according to the document you drew up , sheldon , the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period . were those criteria met ?",no .
3227,why ?,"howard is a complete and total ass , bernadette is in penny’s bed , amy bites , and penny may or may not have coitus with leonard ."
7379,that’s right .,you know what i’m going to do ? i am going to sit here and just let them stew .
8125,really ? levar burton’s coming here ?,possibly . i tweeted him .
3904,just… personal reasons .,my spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with penny .
2277,thanks .,"so , what’s got you up ? did you have a bad clam ?"
7254,how many ?,who cares ? he stole the idea and doesnt deserve his own joke .
1401,"okay , well , i’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order .","excuse me , but was this not your goal ? financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation ? my brilliance and innovation , of course , but still ."
739,fine . then well just stay here and do it .,"well , you didnt suggest a beach house ."
4266,agreed . and we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow .,"well , i have to void my bladder . it was nice spending this time with you ."
9609,are you sure you want to do this ?,the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look .
6952,well…,"oh , i’m sorry , condescending means…"
7061,you said it .,theres no denying i have feelings for you that cant be explained in any other way . i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite . but that seems even more farfetched . the only conclusion was love . i know whats happening . this is a panic attack . soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated .
3851,"i , looked her in the eye , smiled and said , i’m happy for you . because that’s what friends do .",they lie so they don’t look petty .
8406,i’m coming !,"hey , there he is , there’s my old buddy-bud-bud ."
7771,"all right , let me rephrase the question . why are you wearing long underwear ?",you’re kidding . shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you ?
6157,whats up ?,"well , as you may know , ive been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels , and i thought , what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk ?"
7636,"uh , sorry guys , that girl is freaky !",come again ?
674,with lime jello ?,"i need a growth medium , and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt . here , swab my throat ."
6707,"thank you , officer .",it’s all gone . all gone .
7264,you okay ?,"if i was okay , i wouldve said hello , and not the much more ominous hello ."
3841,"look , i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness . if i get the chance to do this , there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me .","very well . things between you and penny have never been better . i hope four months apart doesn’t change anything . i should have opened with that , huh ?"
1815,"how did you even get in , you weirdo ?","yeah , really ? i’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years , but when i do it , it’s weird ?"
8048,i guess this could count as an adventure .,"it was . and even though were not allowed back there , they can never take today away from us . unlike my sense of smell , which hasnt returned since the tasing . no , i got nothing ."
9588,"oh , i don’t know . maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven , the higgs field just got proven , and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started .","yeah , well , i’ve had a lot on my plate . we happen to live in a golden age of television ."
8964,and begin . this is kind of creepy .,were not supposed to talk during this part .
4653,"so , i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb , or they also have the tardis from doctor who .","a tardis makes no sense . it’s a time machine from a science-fiction show . it has nothing to do with halloween . that being said , if you don’t get a tardis , you stink and your party stinks ."
6914,"no , you said , would it help if i said i’m sorry ?",and you never answered me . so who owes whom an apology now ?
2100,sheldon ?,"i’m sorry , leonard , this is toby loobenfeld , he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab , but he also minored in theatre at mit ."
7292,"sheldon , open the door .",i cant . im naked .
1673,"sheldon , go to bed . you have work in the morning .","maybe , maybe not . maybe tomorrow i start a bongo band and tour the world ."
2101,"yeah , i got it , sheldon , why ?","well , you see , while leo would not have gone into rehab , it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel , and coming home with us ."
4213,forget about the bobcat .,how can i ? you won’t stop talking about it .
6586,yes ?,"if i were to give you this gift basket , based on that action alone and no other data , infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us ."
1548,"all i’m saying is , we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…","…tion . okay . for the sake of argument , let’s say i have a problem . what would be your plan for addressing it ?"
6064,"i told you , theres nothing to worry about .","well , ive been doing some research and ive learned that one in 700 , 000 people die from general anaesthesia ."
3323,"if you people think this is better than tom hanks-giving , youre all crazy .","two one six four two zero one nine eight nine . and that , little lady , is pi to a thousand places ."
6862,"oh , i think i see our next stop .","you can’t be serious . if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense , i’d follow leonard on instagram ."
355,she was my second cousin .,and the first woman you ever disappointed sexually . ba-da-bazinga !
5184,what ?,"it’s a kindness , leonard . otherwise , you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips ."
1461,excuse me . i’m amy farrah fowler . you’re sheldon cooper .,"hello , amy farrah fowler . i’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely . additionally , i’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock ."
7213,what ? she didnt give me any puzzles .,are you sure ?
9147,"alright , it’s shredded , what do you want me to do ?",i want you to check before you accept the order .
3220,"uh , i don’t know . are you food ?",that’s not apropos . we’ve already established i’m found in the periodic table .
939,are you sure ? the infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology .,"oh , there it is . it always comes back to monkeys with you . just monkeys , monkeys , monkeys ."
5147,"okay , where is he going ?",leonard is going to the office .
7961,yes . but i need a wing-man .,"alright , but if we’re going to use flight metaphors i’m much more suited to being the guy from the faa , analysing wreckage ."
7456,now three times fast ?,"brobdingnagian , brobdingna… how did you even get it in here ?"
1751,"in a parking lot in hollywood . now , can we please go ?","yes . as soon as i adjust my seat . whee ! oh , dear . i’m going to have to start again ."
9181,you’re kidding .,i never kid about safety .
8733,"hey , aren’t you having breakfast ?",yes .
1772,"you know , people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time , and you totally are , but then it’s like that movie wall-e at the end . you’re so full of love , and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs .","that’s a fairly laboured metaphor , but i appreciate the sentiment behind it ."
1196,"excuse me , if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang .",my apologies . what’s your plan .
1878,for every cup and every…,plateful .
2668,"that could be easily awanged . weady , set , go ?",do it .
3171,"oh , hey , no , you don’t have to apologize . there’s no reason you have to tell me . i was just , you know , surprised .","yes , yes , you were busy , you were surprised , all very fascinating . now where do we stand on the freezer ?"
2016,"oh , please . when i first met you , you were incapable of touching another human being . now you’re holding hands , you’re going on dates , you even made out with her on a train .",she told you ?
2005,i’m putting all this stuff in storage . we don’t need any of it .,"you , how can you say that ? you show me one thing in here we can live without ."
7912,"good-bye , sheldon .","but they’re not blonde , so put on your wig . hello ?"
3893,what if i knocked you unconscious right now ?,it won’t change the past .
9736,"okay , forget the chicken .","well , i wish i could ."
3237,"what’s up , my nerdizzles ? raj , sheldon , i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette .",hello .
4424,by making constipated moose sounds ?,"when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male . you see , when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin . if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love ."
4744,shes just excited about the holidays .,"yes , and shes not taking my feelings into account at all . maybe its time i teach her a lesson ."
2078,un-unravelable ?,"yes , if she googles leopold houston she’ll find a facebook page , an online blog depicting his descent into drug use , and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony . com ."
5219,there he is .,stop it . stop celebrating me .
396,"oh , i’ve got butterflies .","don’t get soft on me , hofstadter . i will slap those glasses right off your face ."
2788,"sheldon , what are you doing here ?",i just came by to say hello .
6753,okay .,"we did it ! i said , we ."
6158,what exactly do you think goes on here ?,"well , conversations that you wouldnt be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex . you know , who has the best cervix . which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now . mens buttocks , and how you want to pat and squeeze them ."
4072,"you don’t know me , you don’t wear my chains… god , that’s a good song .","if you’re compiling a mix cd for a double su1c1de . oh , i hope that scratching post is for you ."
5574,"oh , this heat is brutal .","as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india , you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature ."
8116,"oh , the horror .","indeed . yeah , at one point , raj put on reggae music , and his sister took off her shoes . it was like the last days of caligula . oh , i have to get this . umbrella ?"
9264,"sheldon , don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace .",really ?
5355,"so , listen , there was something i was hoping to float past you .",mm .
6842,that’s not what i meant .,"well , if you were referring to her illness your question should have been , what ails her ?"
8099,come with me to raj’s and eat there .,i can’t do that . what if he serves haggis and blood pudding ?
1519,"i’m happy for you , sheldon . but i have to admit i’m going to miss sharing an office with you .","oh , of course you are . feel free to drop by any time ."
7755,so what happens when it counts down ?,"unless leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds , this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in india saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff leonard hofstadter ."
1378,"no , sorry .",want me to show my work ?
5672,to pay my cable bill .,"all right , pencils down ! i have lokh , makh , and cherrrkh . anybody got those ?"
1023,"sheldon , i don’t care if you want to be friends with penny .","oh . well , so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified ?"
2587,"they developed the relationship closeness inventory , which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour .","yeah , not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory . thats pure cooper ."
6663,but i actually didn’t demote pluto . that was a vote of the international astronomical union .,"if ifs and buts were candy and nuts , we’d all have a merry christmas . think about that , dr . tyson ."
5621,i’m afraid so . you know the cashew chicken i get you monday nights ?,yes . from szechuan palace .
7225,thats not true .,that sounds like us . i still dont understand why youre upset . you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps .
5008,"but , it , it doesn’t matter . we know the answer , come on .","you think you know the answer . but it could be a trick . what if when the puzzle’s complete , there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store ?"
2857,so a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo ?,i suppose it is . except i have a credit card . and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick . and i’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can .
7876,i can’t see him .,"that’s why the call it cloaking , dead man ."
5771,"im sorry , so you never went outside ?",or had a single piece of fruit .
5842,excuse me .,"permission granted , commander ."
8615,"oh , i miss you , too .",i miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store .
5832,"sheldon , we know this is a sensitive subject , and leonards not gonna move out until youre ready .","well , what if you did it gradually ?"
1629,i guess that’s that . let’s go home .,you know what ? i’m going back to i told you so . i told you so .
4888,i know .,"the university , they think they can do whatever they want . we just have to sit there and take it ."
4526,"and while youre at it , i know that at this age your hormones are raging , but just because all your friends are having sex doesnt mean you have to .",why would you say that ?
3523,i haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day leonard made that multiplication error .,"oh , oh , lord , that multiplication error ! he thought he carried the one . but he didn’t ."
5904,"sheldon , youre a remarkable scientist . just be patient , im sure youll find the breakthrough youve been looking for .",thank you .
7358,sheldon ! we’re working here !,"that’s all right . i can barely hear you over my theremin . well , that was a little uncalled for ."
3607,great . was it hard getting it up the stairs ?,
9179,"come on , dude , i’m exhausted , and tyra banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep .","all right . this is a form indemnifying me from your use of leonard’s bedroom . sign here , indicating that i tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression ."
5220,woo !,"and no woos . oh , not you , dr . woo . you’re fine . i want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me . my so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius . it was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake . so please refrain from praising me for it in the future ."
234,"ooh , dark matter . we better bring a flashlight . i was making a joke .",i’m the boss . i make the jokes .
7824,"uh , the couch is good .","hold that thought , leonard , a moment ."
3796,he passed out . just hung there like a big sawami .,d-d-d ! that’s where i sit .
4118,no .,then suffer in silence . play . play . play . stephen hawking . stephen hawking . stephen hawking .
5001,ha-ha .,"oh , see ? now he gets it ."
3800,can i whistle ?,"don’t be silly . howard , you do not have a phd , your cologne is an as*ault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays ."
8536,are you honestly comparing thanksgiving dinner at wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind ?,yes .
3899,"uh , here’s the thing . girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines .",i disagree . your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine . that failure clearly stands on its own .
5024,"because you were about to quit like a big , sheldon , cover your ears .",i’m not a child . i know the word ninny .
1948,what ?,"in anticipation of their arrival , i’ve bagged some evidence . one of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home . you should be able to pull some good prints off this . and now , here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect ."
470,"sheldon , why are you doing this ?","im a teacher , leonard . its my job ."
7144,hello ? what is this ?,we built a fort .
3492,"okay . and to defend , i roll two sixes . i win .","boy , double-sixes again . you know , if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes , i wouldnt believe it . i wonder how long were gonna be stuck here ."
2671,"well , so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood .","i did this . monte was k*ll by my hubris and my pride . no matter what anybody says , this is my fault ."
9550,that would really piss me off if i didn’t have a buzz going on .,"howard , which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train ?"
2224,"no , i experienced some distressing symptoms last night , so i’m checking my vital signs every hour .",i’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis .
1106,"i’m , i’m sorry about that .","and now you’re gone , too . it’s like all the men i’ve looked up to have gone away ."
2188,"okay . um , here’s the thing . so , i’ve known for a while now that leonard has had a little crush on me…","a little crush ? well i suppose so , in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy ."
818,"sheldon , i got to go inside . it’s getting rough out here .","you’re dodging the question , i knew it was you . what was that ?"
5571,we should have asked her to get some funyuns .,youre not going to have funyuns when were a mile below the surface of the earth .
4523,was that a flask ?,"yes . ive decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom , including spiking the punch ."
5793,hi . ready to go ?,"oh , good news , we ordered lunch , so we can all stay here and play lord of the rings risk ."
9143,yes .,did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market ?
8552,"oh , thanks . so , if your dad died when you were 14 , you were never old enough to have a beer with the man .","no , sir . he did try to give me one for my high school graduation , but i was 11 and my mom said no ."
7051,where are you going ?,"i cant do this . and for your information , leonard , the upper flermin doesnt grow between my shoulder blades , it grows out of the belly button on my neck ."
2624,"hey , where have you been ?","oh , leonard . if i was prone to sarcasm , i’d say i was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets ."
6711,"whoever did this knew what they were doing . he got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes , transferred all your stuff , and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint .",oh ! there isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart .
9153,"okay , dead cat named lucky , continue .","while others mourned lucky , i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs . a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night , and yet would be capable of k*ll upon telepathic command ."
9662,"yes , of course .",what about this one ?
8884,"you are . i’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate , and we’ve only got one sh*t .","oh , no ! i can’t !"
888,even though your dress is ugly .,"well , my little flag-keteers , it looks like the last episode of fun with flags is at an end . if i could , i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you . and if you touched the ground , burn you . id like to take a moment to personally thank dr . amy farrah fowler , who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related internet info-tainment show ."
2437,"you know , i will miss this .","i’ll tell you what , if my apples are mealy , we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout . heck , you can even push the cart . please don’t take my looking forward to leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence ."
6056,"sheldon , im gonna get the surgery , its no big deal . end of story .",very well . im done talking about it .
7302,"that’s a hanukkah present you’re regretting , huh ?","i won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged , but if we made an example of one or two , it might give the others incentive to try harder ."
817,so ?,"so , did you do that , or am i in the house with an intruder ?"
8701,you have got to be kidding me !,not at all . frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation .
3414,were on the same planet .,okay . does that planet have to be earth ?
2341,do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great ?,"well put . you know , i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing , but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running ."
8801,"oh , god .","yes , exactly . consequently , if amy and i choose to bring new life into this world , it will be accomplished clinically , with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes . which reminds me , you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour . is your womb available for rental ?"
3167,what ?,"i don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you , but to elaborate , i’m going to the arctic circle with leonard , wolowitz and koothrappali ."

5086,"listen to that little girl , honey , put c . next !","no , no , wait , no , hang on , look at this next question ."
7047,"and while youre at it , i know that at this age your hormones are raging , but just because all your friends are having sex doesnt mean you have to .",why would you say that ?
5835,you got it .,"there we go , compromising again . we really are the best ."
5194,"well , for starters , you’ve broken up with me so many times , which first date are we talking about ?","ooh , somebody call the burn ward . and back to the zone ."
4449,"oh , you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time .",yeah ? we have to be somewhere .
4945,"yeah , i saw those . they were funny . i printed a few out and put ‘em on my fridge .","so , when could we start ?"
4045,"by doing none of it . no dinner , no romance , no gifts . we stay here , order a pizza and watch one of your beloved star w*r trek things .",really ?
6156,come in .,ladies .
3702,"think about it , sheldon . i’m not a stranger , we’re intellectually compatible , i’m willing to chauffeur you around town , and your personality quirks , which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing , i find cute as a button . what do you think ?",um…

8645,"denial . denial , denial . come in .",thank you .
1587,you were just a little kid .,"yeah , a little kid who picked the wrong format to record the macneil/lehrer report . now i also was certain that hd dvd would win out over blu-ray ."

3858,"i’m gonna miss you , too .","penny , we’re in the red zone . the white zone is for loading and unloading . we’re breaking the law ."
9564,"in 1944 , the pacific railroad built number 6131 , which rearranged the drivers and cylinders , solving the problem of the q-1 , creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four .",in what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four ?

436,i said ill get to it .,"im sensing awkwardness , am i right ?"
7666,"there’s no cholera in pasadena . just like last summer , when there was no malaria in pasadena .","well , if it’s not cholera , then based on a quick internet search , the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung’s disease , botulism , a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms ."
8329,"uh , no , that’s not it . just come with me , please .",let’s see what i’ll be washing that succotash down with . a pitcher of margaritas .

6998,thanks for coming with me .,thanks for giving me your limited edition green lantern lantern .
6912,"sheldon , i have a working understanding of physics .","yeah , good for you , and don’t stop working on it ."
6046,"well , how could you not put in an abort ?","i made a boo-boo , all right ?"
2158,"apples and oranges here , sheldon . i’m telling you , that girl is a user , iceskating through the life on her looks , taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men , getting auditions for stupid network shows . it creams my corn .",may i interject something here ?
6239,"you don’t want that , do you ?",no . but it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated . who was at the door ?
1497,"ignore him , pwesident siebert . i’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate .","oh , he’s just trying to butter you up . and for the record , butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam ."
4545,"yes ! sorry , tell me about professor proton .",professor proton hosted my favourite science show when i was a child . i never missed an episode . he demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects .
4257,thank you .,you’re welcome . but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot .

9003,"alright , you know they have dvds over there .","yes , but they have dvd burners over here . leonard needs a dvd burner ."
2092,"let it go , sheldon , the m*rder was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not .","no , that’s the least of our worries . i’ve been doing some research on addiction , both the biochemical and behavioural aspects , and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie ."
5409,interrupting physiâ€¦,muon !
2015,"okay , i have not tried to change leonard . that’s just what happens in relationships . look how much amy’s changed you .",that’s not true .
8825,but the light indicates…,don’t bother . i’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill .
4044,"and i appreciate your effort , but upon contemplation , i decided i was being selfish . so , i cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate valentine’s day .",what is that ?
187,i don’t need to see your presentation . this discussion is over !,that’s a somewhat ambiguous response . am i going or not ?
6492,"oh , i’m sorry , shelly , i can’t see it .","well , whether you see it or not is irrelevant . i can’t see subatomic particles , but nevertheless , they’re there ."
3655,and you’re going to stay calm ?,i said i would .
3426,he was overacting on purpose .,really ? he reminded me of a young william shatner .
7852,"hi fellas . oh , where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin ?","he’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good . where he comes from , that’s punishable by death ."
1381,"all right , fine . how are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment ?","you’re thinking of the moving assembly line , an understandable but not excusable mistake . no . the moving assembly line , that was introduced by henry ford in 1908 . that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods . i guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your radiohead ."
8607,i don’t know . why ?,paraffin candles may contain carcinogens . unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast . dinfast .
413,good luck .,"no , wait . i need you to call stan lee , leonard nimoy and bill nye the science guy , ’cause , legally , i’m not allowed to . oh , and , also , carrie fisher , you know , ’cause i hear he can be pretty nuts ."
5037,"goodnight , sheldon .",but how am i going to get to work ?
4897,no .,please .
3336,exactly .,"for the record , that kid was a terrible choice . if you cry when you drop your churro , you do not have what it takes to rule england ."
3606,what were you doing in his closet ?,i helped run some cable for a webcam .
3175,a little bit .,two for two . i’m on fire .
2241,no .,"don’t . it’s terrible . however , in it , we learn that when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half , he suppresses them using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinar ."
9462,"yeah , okay , like you said .","huh . seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse . donâ€™t you have access to women who will do it for money ? by the way , another accepted usage for the term ho ."

256,so you were wrong .,i didn’t say that .
8707,"yeah , i’ll just tell her you said hey .","okay , well , it was pleasant seeing you , other than that business with my testicles ."
200,"ooh , we’re honey now , are we ?","yes . since their relationship became carnal , penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment , thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie , usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult ."
2235,there was no question . i simply said hoo .,"all right , i think i have enough to go on . possible explanations for your symptoms are , in descending order of likelihood , hyperthyroidism , premature menopause , hosting an alien parasite or , and i only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases , sexual arousal ."
4743,"come on , sheldon , you have to get her something .","why should i ? she knows that i dont like christmas , and yet , every year , she forces me to celebrate it . not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will , at the christmas tree lot , there was mistletoe , and she kissed me under it in public . like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show ."
1767,"oh , next question .","i’ll put , in progress . okay , moving to psychiatric disorders , list all major behavioural diagnoses , e . g . depression , anxiety , etcetera ."
4236,"all i’m saying is , if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent hulk movie , they could probably just make an actual hulk .",that is apt and amusing . i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler . she’ll appreciate the witticism .
8832,that’s an amusing factoid .,thank you .
8229,"okay , partner , lets do it .",come on . click the mouse with me .
6779,sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change .,nuts to that . what else you got ?

3363,subtle .,"but you got it , right ?"
1088,"sweetie , are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral ?","oh , i appreciate the offer , but arthur is gone and there’s nothing i can do about it . when darth vader struck down obi-wan , did luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral ?"
4674,"oh , uh , you probably dont want her to see this . its unnecessarily graphic .","hold on , doctor . leonard , where are your social k*ll ? this man is clearly upset . we should invite him in for a hot beverage ."

3559,"okay , smart guy . i’m about to remove the locus coeruleus , which is incredibly delicate work . have at it .",all right . i’m no stranger to a little gray matter . locus coeruleus . locus coeruleus .
8920,but look how well you turned out .,"id feign modesty at this point , but who would believe me ? still , you need to consider how successful leonards brother and sister are ."
2841,it tastes the same .,no . the syrup tastes better and i don’t like it .
2311,what are you grinding about ?,"penny’s brain teaser this morning . she and koothrappali emerge from your bedroom . she is dishevelled , and raj is dressed only in a sheet . the sole clue , it’s not what it looks like ."
8562,"oh , i always tear up when the grinch’s heart grows three sizes .","tears seem appropriate . enlargement of the heart muscle , or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure ."
3234,"hey , leonard , check this out .","leonard , she’s doing it again ."
4152,i don’t want to go anywhere .,"you know , i’m given to understand that there is an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems . where you can replace them with"

6408,i’m going to a party . i’m not turning r2-d2 and c-3po over to the empire !,not yet .
6698,what’s going on ?,"they stole everything , leonard , everything ."

4778,what do you mean ?,"well , if we assume your looks are average , yeah , right off the bat , fifty percent of men on earth are more attractive than you . that’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by , waiting to rain on your parade ."
5845,"oh , boy , do i ?",sarcasm ?
9452,"come on , sheldon , please teach me about football . itâ€™ll be fun .","thatâ€™s exactly what my father said . come to the games , watch the games , week in and week out from the time i was five until i went off to college . longest seven years of my life ."

7567,it’s a…,"boy , that does smell good . too bad it’s monday ."
2490,"hey , i said i was sorry . what else do you want from me ?",i want you to admit that what you did was wrong .
9433,penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead !,"that’s your badge of honour , your warrior’s wound , if you will . i was wrong , minstrels will write songs about you ."
4935,"well , that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy .",do you realize that teaching is the first thing i’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in march of 1989 ?
3935,dessert is served .,i just had cobbler .
6584,this one . let’s go .,you put no thought into that .
2384,forget it .,"so , you can experiment on all the apes you want . but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings , suddenly im the monster ."
115,sheldon i didn’t mean it like that .,then why did you say it .
8083,"yeah , me , too . somewhere around the third floor i began to see a , a white light .",i’ll get leonard .

8856,that was pretty droll . with a hint of ammonia .,"yes , enjoy your japes , gentlemen . you think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic . well , you’ve forgotten one thing . i am also a son of the lone star state . i’m texas through and through . and we know how to settle scores down there . if you doubt me , ask mexico ."

3802,okay . you know what ? i see where this is going . i’m not one of you guys . i’m not a scientist . so just…,"penny , penny , penny . everything you’re saying is true , but please allow me to continue . raj , you’re out . the good question , while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group , your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing . how could you , for a moment , think that my favourite amino acid is glutamine ?"
6068,great timing . my check sphincter light just went on .,"leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeons latex gloves ?"
5810,"uh , ive got some bad news . theres no cell service in here .","oh . well , thats all right . there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented ."

5113,compromise . watch babylon 5 .,in what sense is that a compromise ?
557,"sheldon , you have two choices . either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo , or you delete stuff before we go out of town .","but once you open the box , you’ve voided the warranty . the warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer . he offers to stand by his equipment , and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware . this little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy ."
7665,what the hell ? what’s the matter ?,i have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen . i’m nauseated and feverish . i believe i may have cholera .

6911,"that’s incredible . oh , here , break out the math .","oh , okay , let me see this . all right , so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time . now , i was thinking… howard , you go ahead and eat . this isn’t going to make any sense to you ."
1510,"sheldon , stop . he’s screwing with you .","is he ? well , then , it seems we have reached an impasse . i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel . i’d smack you with a glove , but just last week i packed away my winter things ."
3829,eleven . wait . do i count the 200-pound sailor moon girl that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con ?,sure .
3732,"and since you love the truth so much , why don’t you tell amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me ?",i thought we were talking about the other thing .
7527,no .,i’m glad because i would not have seen that coming .
3211,"don’t worry . just sit next to me during the quiz , and you can copy my answers .","raj ? what are you doing ? i don’t think so . you’ve had your allotted six ounces . the first bathroom break isn’t until the denny’s located near bakersfield , which is approximately two and half hours away . remember , people , we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder ."

5985,"so , you’re going to go work at the patent office ?","don’t be absurd . that’s in washington . you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern . no . i’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task , freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem ."
1140,"yes , and you’ve never met one of them .",that’s the beauty of it .
3162,sheldon .,penny .
6207,understandable .,can i make you a cup of tea ?
2046,see you .,you just lied to penny .
3730,"sheldon , what did you say ?","i said the truth . you don’t want to live with leonard , and you know it ."
1909,"uh , a smile means something different in my country . you know , tears of joy , smile of sadness . india’s a goofy place .","oh , i’m back to trains . woo-woo ."

8509,youâ€™re not the guy .,"are you sure ? that would explain so much . your constant presence in my apartment , that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me , the way you call me sweetie all the time ."

2834,they just don’t appreciate you .,"yeah , and on top of that , leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and penny are engaged , he may not want to live with me any more ."
8941,"uh , well , id probably sleep in , do a little yoga , then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing .",thats it ?
5880,"yeah , have fun .","oh , i will , nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science ."
1237,"sheldon , they’re talking about sex .","oh , then i’m out ."

5673,"isn’t it obvious ? every week , they kick out a beautiful girl , making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem , a . k . a . the future mrs . howard wolowitz .",is my hamburger medium well ?
946,don’t worry . mama’s here to take care of her baby .,"and just to be clear , only her baby and not these other people ."
8141,no .,"of course it did . it’s said that archimedes , the ancient greek mathematician , discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath ."
5498,"sheldon , it’s saturday night , you’ll be doing laundry .","don’t tell him that , tell him the mask thing ."
6693,"oh . sheldon , you can’t fix this with gifts .","nevertheless , i’ve hurt you , and whether you forgive me or not , i want you to have this ."
8993,"sheldon , do you understand the concept of blackmail ?","well of course i… oh ! yeah , i have an idea , let’s throw leonard a kick ass birthday party ."
2721,no .,it’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma .
1932,i should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance .,"interesting . so it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow , as it were ."
7018,i don’t get it . you had a great time .,"yes , exactly , i had a great time . that’s done , i’ve moved on to other things . for example , after i learn finnish , i’m not going to learn finnish again ."
3236,you want me to put it back ?,leonard .
3140,wait a minute . he offered to send you to the north pole ?,"yes . in fact , he was quite enthusiastic . he said , “frankly , if i could send you tonight , i would . ”"
4163,oh-oh . i just remembered where the emergency key is .,where ?
8656,"well , that should do it .",thank you for coming by . hello .
3807,"no , that’s wong . there’s an official schedule . i have no contwol over it .","oh . this entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility . raj , you’re back in . he likes monkeys ."
9236,"sheldon , kripke’s not smarter than you . you just got stuck on a wrong path . happened to einstein . he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades .","oh , don’t play the einstein card . his great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything . so everything was a great breakthrough ."
6608,"listen , rajesh , leonard and i have decided to see each other again , and you don’t get to tell me who i can and can’t have a relationship with .","actually , he can . the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters . if a woman’s father is not around , the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family , in this case , raj . the code also states that if she disobeys , she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases . if true , that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is leonard ."
8672,yep . i had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on .,is that what that was ? i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical .
4154,"hello , sheldon .",and how are you doing this fine evening ?
4172,"okay , i give up , can we just do something else ?",fine . i was spock . are you and leonard friends with benefits .
796,"oh , my god , no .","at the hot dog stand in the denver train station , heinz ketchup . at the hot dog stand in the salt lake city train station , heinz ketchup . at the hot dog stand in the indianapolis train station ?"
2416,"well , thank you for sharing it with me . i wont tell anyone .",thank you .
8906,"i do . and some of its wool , so dry flat if possible .","oh , and heres a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree ."
6139,ready ? begin . whyd you pop it ?,"im sorry , i was aiming for your heart ."
785,not yet .,"well , perhaps i can help . sherlock holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . now , have , have you tried doing that ?"
6687,what ?,i’ll reprogram howard .
3158,"oh , damn it . peer pressure . fine .","excellent . and just an fyi , as i am the expedition’s team leader , protocol dictates that be phrased fine , sir . but don’t worry , there will be a briefing ."
123,you are not isaac newton .,"no , no that’s true , gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple ."
9215,want me to make you some tea ?,tea is for when i’m upset . i’m not upset . the university’s forcing me to work with kripke . i’m outraged .
6995,oy .,"is that you , raj ? i don’t recognize your edge ."
2172,"i’m not going to do that , howard .",i’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all .
2169,why are you learning chinese ?,i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them .
4009,"hey guys . this is lalita gupta , lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny . isn’t it great , she isn’t fat any more !","forgive me your highness , for i am but a monkey , and it is in my nature to climb . i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair ."
9058,120 ?,"oh , i’m sorry , did i insult you ? is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth ?"
4340,don’t you usually get lemonade ?,yes .
910,"so , shelly , what’s up with you and your friend amy , if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit ?","well , there’s actually big news on the amy front . she’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals . she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine ."
6268,you ?,"violation of the roommate agreement , overnight guest notification clause ."
7349,world’s greatest astrophysicist ?,don’t thank me . you earned it .
2309,or what ?,don’t answer that . it’s a trick question . i speak from experience .
9412,weird .,"oh , good , that was an unusual interaction . i wasn’t sure ."
3634,what ?,"i am truly sorry for what happened last night , i take full responsibility . and i hope that it won’t colour your opinion of leonard , who is not only a wonderful guy , but also , i hear , a gentle and thorough lover . i did what i could ."
1257,i didn’t spoil anything .,"you told me it’s mind-blowing , so , my mind is going into it pre-blown . and once a mind is pre-blown , it cannot be re-blown ."
4458,"sheldon , im really impressed youre willing to try this .","well , admittedly , this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat , small places , going below floor-level , dampness , hatches , ladders , darkness , echoes , and eliminating in home depot buckets . that last one is quite new , but i have a feeling thats gonna rocket to the top of the list ."
6133,what do you mean ?,"according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson , in order to maximize performance , one must create a state of productive anxiety . so id like to ask you all to do something for me . keep me on my toes . just throw me off my game . essentially , go out of your way to make my life miserable ."
1178,excuse me ?,that woman in there’s not going to have sex with you .
4652,"hello , boys .",what are you smiling at ?
6218,can you believe it ? little priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in india .,"given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large indian car company , it’s actually extremely plausible ."
3650,"no , no , no , i , i looked , and there’s , there’s , there’s no more tickets .","leonard , let me look in the box ."
442,"dr . cooper , while you were away , we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study .","wow . pouting and running away actually worked . i must say , that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me . so , um , what is the solution ?"
3415,are you asking me to go to mars with you ?,"i am . yeah , if im going to a barren , lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none , i want you there with me . why dont we go back to the apartment , and fill out your application ?"
1399,"the fifth annual east rutherford , new jersey , gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender alliance luau .","oh , another market to expand into , balding gay men ."
1457,why ?,what’s life without whimsy ?
7113,uh-huh .,"looks like that laptop’s seen better days . if you’re interested , i’m selling this . it’s only two years old , 16 gigabytes of ram , intel core i7 processor , and i can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis ."
5744,"you are most certainly welcome , sexy .","well done , dr . koothrappali ."
1054,yesterday . you made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it .,when is the last time i asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency ?
6421,"sorry , slim . i’ve got some mr . data dolls in the trunk of my car . you want me to sign one for you ?","you’ve already signed something , brent spiner . your name on my list . from this moment on , you are my mortal enemy ."
3275,hey ! you don’t have to be so mean !,i’m sorry . have you suffered a recent blow to the head ?
1463,"i don’t object to the concept of a deity , but i’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance .","well , then you might want to avoid east texas ."
3699,what if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways ?,"that would be ideal . if a person like that existed , i would sign on , no further questions asked ."
3759,"it’s kinda cute , until you get to the scrotum .",what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me ?
929,"oh , doctors are always changing their mind . one week bacon grease is bad for you . the next week we’re not getting enough of it . good morning , shelly .","mom , i want to apologize for my behaviour last night ."
5511,"excuse me , but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment . i’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals , i received a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physics .","no , that can’t be it . and since you seem to have forgotten , the reason we live together is we’re best friends . and i got your back , jack ."
8193,"ooh , me .","penny , a moment . we just had thai food . in that culture , the last morsel is called the krengjai piece , and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group ."

2928,"no , but it’s close . look at the markings inside . those are production markings . nine rings were made for use in the lord of the rings movies . three were given to members of the cast . the rest were destroyed . except one . one was stolen . gentlemen , this is the one ring .",mine !
8868,"yeah , me , too . i can’t make up my mind .",are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies ?
4221,yes .,"i knew it . just keep going , i guess i’m good at this ."
3546,"no , i just need those beakers washed . hippity-hop , quick like a bunny .","what ? excuse me , you have dr . sheldon cooper in your lab . you’re gonna make him do the dishes ? that’s like asking the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar ."
5598,how can i calm down ? i’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart . that’s three hours of picking out shoes just sh*t to hell .,"hello , penny ."
8704,go on .,"you donate eggs . we will place them in cryogenic storage . i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs , have them fertilized and implanted in you , that way everybody wins ."

913,your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on burbank .,get them before they get us .
7868,so ?,"it’s the chinese restaurant all over again . i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men , each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman ."

4928,yeah .,"good evening , leonard , howard , raj , freeloader ."
8516,anything else ?,i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship .
7689,i am looking at you .,"no , you’re not . pay no attention to that man in the bed ."
6,"i know what it means , sheldon ! god , you know , i have been in l . a . for almost two years now , and i haven’t got a single acting job , i have accomplished nothing , haven’t gotten a raise at work , haven’t even had sex in six months , and just now when i was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and i ate it .","well , actually , insects are a dietary staple in many cultures , they’re almost pure protein ."
2980,when did you pick up on that ?,"a moment ago , when you turned off the tv in the middle of }during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode . would you like some advice ?"
3361,not your fault .,is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist i didnt correct him ?
4774,"no , you didn’t .","well , it’s your word against mine; see you in court ."
1943,what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes ?,"leonard , are we having a serious conversation or not ?"
7044,was that a flask ?,"yes . ive decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom , including spiking the punch ."
5499,"well , normally i respect your macho rebellious attitude toward the man , but , in this case , i think you’ve made a foolish mistake .","unlikely . but make your case . keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our saturday night together , and i’m not above minimizing your window ."
1635,"oh , look who they let in .","don’t worry , wil wheaton . i was just leaving . da-da-da-da , da-da-da !"
1141,i’m going to invite her over . we’ll have a nice meal and chat .,chat ? we don’t chat . at least not offline .
2041,what the hell is that ?,"i don’t know , but if cats could sing , they’d hate it too . ."

2070,well imagine how i’m feeling .,hungry ? tired ? i’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit .
3134,"yes , how did we live before twitter ? i guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning .","that’s 14 hours away . for the next 840 minutes , i’m effectively one of heisenberg’s particles , i know where i am or i know how fast i’m going , but i can’t know both . yet how am i supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head ?"
5160,sorry !,i am glad you asked . are you familiar with the higgs boson ?
9459,"iâ€™s the smallest size they had , except the one for dogs . i canâ€™t believe they had one for dogs .","oh , yes . canine football fans are a common sight in texas . cats , however , refuse to wear sporting apparel . my sister found that out the hard way ."

1474,"so , you think i’m one of the smarter kids ?","no , you’re a tool i was using to make my point ."
8366,"okay , look , if leonard finds out that i lied , i will absolutely die of embarrassment .",physiologically impossible .
1889,"say , i heard an interesting tidbit about howard and bernadette .","really , amy ? gossip ? i’m disappointed in you ."
3435,then amy got mad and left ?,walked right out the door .
7182,yeah .,"ive invented a science joke , would you like to hear it ?"
7278,"okay , imagine your problems are a pen .",okay .
3705,what do you want ?,"hey , good buddy . so , uh , i was just talking to amy , and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing ."
2021,"i’m not surprised you want to end the relationship . i’m a little surprised you didn’t get applecare . anyway , enjoy your life . where do i sign ?","at the bottom . i must say , i’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this ."
4020,"sheldon , are you hungry ?",i could eat .
8600,thank you for taking me to the airport .,you’re very welcome .
8222,you worked out all the math .,"oh , i did more than work out all the math . i wrote a paper ."

2658,"tomowow , thwee o’clock , the kinetics wab .",make it so .
6521,"wait , wait , hold on , back up . you’re having a woman stay with you ?",yes . why does that seem to flabbergast everybody ?
1130,significant improvement over the old neighbour .,"two hundred pound tr*nsv*stite with a skin condition , yes she is ."
5557,how hot is it ?,"uh , lets see . 704 ? no , wait , its on clock . uh , the real answer isnt much better . 102 degrees ."
6958,sheldon ! i need your help !,"what is it now , mrs . wolowitz ?"
1819,"okay , go home , crazy man .","yeah . did you know that while leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country , in today’s north korea , he’s downright average . hey , talk about a keeper ."
7127,"and at the same time , not .",it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldnt let me in . i hated that so much .
7075,all that story does is make me feel bad for your mother .,"leonard , you’re my best friend . why don’t you ever take my side ?"
4318,"i don’t want to play a game , sheldon .","it’s called scientists . now , i will name three scientists , then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields . to make this game even more compelling , you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field , not the validity of the field itself . for example , abu musa jabir ibn hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology . okay , ready to have some fun ?"
9359,"you know , i got some candles in my apartment .","but candles ? during a blackout ? are you mad ? that’s a fire hazard . no , pasadena water and power recommends the far safer glow stick ."

5476,"cancel my next appointment . this is gonna take a while . dr . cooper , you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace .",like what ?
9586,"are you kidding me ? this may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime . how can you , as a theoretical physicist , not care about this ?","maybe it’s because i’m not an elitist . what i’d like to know is , how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street ? you know ? who’s looking out for joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns ?"
1856,"because when he wasn’t happy , we wanted to k*ll him . there was even a plan . we were going to throw his kindle outside , and when he went to get it , lock the door and let him freeze to death .",that seems like a bit of an overreaction .
2282,"yeah , congratulations .","congratulations ? the newcomb medal ? oh , please . that’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework ."
7847,"oh , that’s so cool . my first jew !",i imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers .
9082,"oh , you got yourself a loom , how nice .",thank you .
4093,"oh , who am i kidding , i can’t go through with this , you need to call her and cancel .",me ?

5200,"yeah , i read your paper online . that technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired .","oh , well , thank you . believe it or not , i just learned a chinese research team at the hubei institute for nuclear physics ran a test on a cyclotron , and the results were extremely promising ."
6401,"for god’s sake , will you stop with the schrodinger stuff .","would you prefer a simpler application of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle , in which i could either know where you are or whether i like you , but not both ?"
9675,ha-ha .,you call tech support .
3421,"don’t worry , it wasn’t terrible . just , this time , try to say it the way people sound . and action .","my friend , wil wheaton ."
9031,"i know , i’m familiar with you .","at the last department party , dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes ."
386,to my room .,should i follow you ?
8324,that’s cruel . you know it goes straight to my hips .,"gentlemen , please focus . you’re facing a fire-breathing dragon ."
1628,sorry . fire regulations . should’ve gotten here earlier .,this is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary . explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t .
3585,"unless , superman matches her speed and decelerates .","in what space , sir , in what space ? she’s two feet above the ground . frankly , if he really loved her , he’d let her hit the pavement . it would be a more merciful death ."
7008,you help me run my game .,okay . what is your game ?
2714,you’re unbelievable .,i know .
8764,"don’t come in here , don’t come in here , don’t come in here , don’t aw ! what’s going on ?",shh ! ramona’s sleeping on the couch .
8214,what ? is it wrong ? have you seen it somewhere else ?,hmm .
9083,"honey , why did you get a loom ?","i was working with luminous fish , and i thought , hey , loom ! mom , what are you doing here ?"
5659,yeah . what did they say ?,"too bad your show is done . i kind of liked it . leonard , did you hear that ? oh , the people are heartbroken . i cant take this away from the world . fun with flags is back ."
3189,i don’t think i can go to the north pole .,"okay , leonard , i know you’re concerned about disappointing me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low ."
9713,stairwell .,"uh-oh , flashlight went out . i need some batteries . fellas ? hello ? it’s really dark down here ."
4305,yay .,"you’re a natural at this , penny . and as the first beta testers , you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday ."
909,what’s the last thing you were ever happy about ?,the prospect of fried chicken .
5385,yeah .,"boy , you chase one balloon for three miles ."
1996,"guys , you’re being childish .","yeah , she’s right . you’re grown men , the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches ."
1866,"sheldon , why are you sitting by yourself ?","because i am without friends . like the proverbial cheese , i stand alone . even while seated ."
1842,damn his vulcan hearing .,"you fellows are planning a party for me , aren’t you ?"
2497,"come on , don’t be like that . we had so much fun together the last couple of months .",you’re right . which makes your betrayal all the more devastating .
201,you’re boring people sweetie .,"although , sometimes , she omits the veil entirely ."
7478,"uh , i’m sorry , can we just pause for a minute ?",what’s wrong ?
7305,can you say that and not make it sound like i’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet ?,"no . the two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable , though if pressed , i’d have to give a slight edge to the cat . i’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer . i agree to be part of your project . congratulations ."
5054,too bad .,you’re going up euclid avenue ?
5889,"ugh , what ?",you sounded in distress . i was worried something unpleasant was happening to you . like a m*rder . or spontaneous coitus with leonard .
4006,"oh , yeah , i tried to watch that online , but they wanted a credit card .",it’s a children’s story .
9648,with a beautiful girl on your arm .,and a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball .
2702,"look how sweet he is . come over and say hi . come on . you can do it . don’t be scared . come on . oh , just pet the bird , you big baby !","i did it ! i actually did it . okay , now flush him ."
3449,you could have a long island iced tea .,will that calm my nerves ?
331,"sheldon , what are you doing here ?",hang on . 130 over 80 . a little high . we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk .
6751,so did you at least get sheldon’s fake stuff back ?,no . we failed in our noble quest .
8727,what if i brought food to your place ?,"that would be acceptable . on mondays , i eat thai food . mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from siam palace ."
7722,"oh , i’m not confused at all . you’re like a sexy toddler .",i don’t know how to process that .
6843,what ails her ?,oh . who knows ?

7552,should we stop holding hands now ?,in a minute .
2686,"no , but she might think i think it’s a date even though i don’t .",or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t .

8326,are we ready to order ?,one moment . i’m conducting an experiment .
5806,"it does , somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it .","well , once again , its what i do ."
8506,"okay , listen to me . playing games is not gonna help get amy back .","i am not trying to get her back . but , out of curiosity , what is a way ?"
9029,"sounds like a breakthrough , should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover ?","it’s time travel , leonard , i will have already done that ."
3052,"okay , the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass .","the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him , and no one else was ."
8412,"not that secret , the other secret .",i’m batman . shhhhh !
5462,"i think it’s pretty wide open . oh , wait . here’s something at four o’clock . give alex a talking to ?","well , that snuck up on us , didn’t it ?"

3789,"hey , look at you , cooper . you’re almost halfway to the top .",i am ? i was wrong . it is a fear of heights .
2220,we get it . 73 is the chuck norris of numbers .,"chuck norris wishes . in binary , 73 is a palindrome , one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one , exactly the same . all chuck norris backwards gets you is sirron kcuhc ."
5075,okay .,and radio shack .
2331,"here , here .","excuse me . it’s major sheldon cooper . with my last breath , i awarded myself a battlefield promotion . it’s kind of a big deal ."

7032,"i got to go , bye .",penny ? penny ? penny ? penny ? penny ?
7631,no .,"if you let me use negative reinforcement , i can get it done before we go to bed ."

4088,i’m having a panic attack .,"oh , okay , well then , calm down ."
1967,but you don’t like other people .,i do tonight . it’s scary over there .
9618,"sheldon , your food’s getting cold . what are you doing ?","oh , looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry . why do we have a geology book ? leonard , did you throw a children’s party while i was in texas ?"
8570,"merry newton-mas , everyone .","i sense that’s not sincere , although i have no idea why ."
9341,"i’m sorry , sheldon , i’m busy . i’m right in the middle of my addiction study . i’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys , and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to o’doul’s .","you’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need ? oh , where’d the magic go ?"

595,so ?,people don’t go in my room !
8355,how is that not a braniac ?,"well , for one thing , she was french . for another , it was literature ."
3917,"right now , howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny jewish greek god . zeusowitz .","i must admit , i can’t help but feel a twinge of envy . he can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes . his dim , uncomprehending eyes . it’s like a cat in an airport carrying case ."
6142,"sheldon , youre a remarkable scientist . just be patient , im sure youll find the breakthrough youve been looking for .",thank you .
5661,"sheldon , that wasnt for you .","oh , no , im not going to drink it . i just wanted to hear the pop . yeah , i knew it was coming . still scary ."
5778,just tell her .,i called leonard because i failed . and i didnt want you to think less of me .
3618,"fine . i accept your premise , now please let’s go .",i am not leaving until i’m done .
839,"i wasn’t going to get alcohol . gosh , i wonder what leonard’s doing right now . i miss him so much .","well , if you’d like , we could call him . i mean that you could call him . as i’ve explained , the absence of my friends does not cause me pain . as rock and roll bad boy paul simon once said , i am a rock , i am an i-i-i-island ."
4596,no one wants to hear it .,"why , die . why did he die ? old , told . i was told he was old ."
7452,you said i could buy a desk .,this isn’t a desk . this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity .
141,"yeah , i am pulling out all the stops . there’s a $39 . 95 lover’s special at p . f . chang’s . egg rolls , dumplings , bottomless wok , and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front .","given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded , wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal m*rder ?"
2597,does it matter ?,"no , as long as it bobbles ."
6701,into the bag .,they took my battle ostrich .
1377,that just can’t be right .,you’re questioning my math ?
3674,"oh , oh , no , no . it’s because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held . according to father solakian , no one attended . luckily , my trip wasn’t a complete waste . i lit a candle and prayed for your death but i’m not armenian , so it probably won’t work . this is over , right ?","oh , not necessarily . i suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in armenia or lebanon ."
8542,it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met . were you unable to consummate the marriage ?,hah ! penny ? next .

6362,"good evening , ladies and gentlemen . my name is dr . leonard hofstadter , and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s chancellor’s award for science and my good friend , dr . sheldon cooper . but before i do , i’d like to share with you a letter from sheldon’s mother , who couldn’t be here tonight . isn’t that nice ? his mother sent him a letter . she’s proud of him . i wonder what that feels like . dear shelly . that’s what she calls him . shelly , it’s a pet name . you know what my mother’s pet name for me is ? leonard . but i digress . dear shelly . i am so proud of…","oh , dear ."
4741,maybe youd like it more if you thought of santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children .,"my uncle was accused of that , too . it turned out to be legal in oklahoma ."
3808,should we do something for her ?,i know . let’s go see the new spider-man movie .
1138,"i think we should be good neighbours , invite her over , make her feel welcome .",we never invited louis-slash-louise over .
2257,yeah . that’s not what i had in mind .,oh . oh ! you mean something i could do .
7438,you’re being unreasonable . why can’t i have a desk ?,our collaboration is a work of the mind . we don’t need desks .
1787,would you feel more comfortable if i ate raisinets ?,"well , it’s hardly my business what you eat , as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s raisinets ."
3938,you do ?,yes . you’re my ride .
7474,didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas ?,yes .
4646,really ? i find that inconsistent with everything i know about you .,"oh , oh , on the contrary . couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship . now imagine this , you and i entering stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see america’s most beloved and glamorous couple ."
459,"im thinking about getting my doctorate , and he wants to teach . why not ?","oh , howard . i appreciate the gesture , but this is a graduate-level physics class . i dont think youd understand a single thing i was talking about ."
6115,"yeah , sure .",okay . go ahead .
9299,really ? what tipped you off ?,"couple things , actually . your tone of voice , your body language…"
948,you can have whatever you want .,"thanks , mom . you’re the best ."
3700,great . here i am !,wait . here who is where ?
1336,"please , sheldon , i am so not in the mood .","leonard , all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love . and look at us . at this moment , we are , in fact , a star trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment , relying only on our wits , our fortitude and our moxie . as long as we have those things , nothing can stop…"
6370,you might want to check youtube .,what do i search ?
4628,like behavior modification ?,"yeah , exactly . did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong ?"
6286,"to , uh , lucky baldwin’s .","oh , i’ve heard of that place , isn’t that pasadena’s favourite irish watering hole ."

441,"you mean the dialogue that went , please , no , please , no , please , no .","thats the one . i believe you went last , so , uh , please ?"
6659,"i’m sorry , dr . cooper , this matter is already closed .",but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go .
1602,exactly . they say it finally solves the submarine controversy .,"did leonard ? i’m no expert , but i believe what we just heard from penny was sarcasm . oh , good . i’m eight for 26 this month ."
2238,"i think we need to face the cold , hard truth , i was sexually aroused by penny’s friend zack .",hang on . i don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake .
639,"okay , okay . uh , ""the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false . i wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish . """,who wrote that ?
9570,why are you still here ?,excuse me . i think you’re being a little rude .
3830,i’ll stick with eleven . she liked howard better .,"well , now do you see the problem ?"
9156,and mythological .,"irrelevant . see , i was studying recombinant dna technology and i was confident i could create one , but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen . course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them ."
6144,"look , your anxiety levels are right in the zone .","really ? oh , thats fantastic . now , wait , theyre dropping . why are they dropping ?"
7551,it’s over .,yeah .
8818,you’re welcome .,i wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops . it’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops .
6344,"yeah , that’s when i buy shoes . now , let’s see what we’ve got . ooh ! this is nice .",it’s only one colour .
9585,"what do you think about it , sheldon ?",meh .
1958,"it won’t happen again , what’s up ?",nothing . just wanted to see if you were both okay .
1070,"and if you don’t start treating me better , i’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named armin .",armin who ?
155,"yeah . we also put in what happens if one of us wins a macarthur grant , or if one of us gets superpowers , or if one of us is bitten by a zombie .","he can’t k*ll me , even if i turn ."

4578,what do you two talk about ?,"i wrote a fan letter to you when i was a child in texas , and you sent this autographed picture back to me . do you remember that ?"
1089,"no , he blew up the death star . why do i know this ?","arthur jeffries was a scientist . i’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals . you know , if he were here , i think he’d say enjoy star wars day ."
6049,"come on , hes an under-appreciated genius .",still think its me .
6415,what are you doing here ?,"fighting for our friendship . as peculiar and annoying as you can be , you’re still my little buddy . i’m not going to let that end here tonight . now put down that drink , let’s meet brent spiner and go home ."
2940,and it wasn’t when we were driving like this ?,i would advise the three of you that resistance is futile . i have endless patience . i once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with hewlett-packard customer service just to complain about their customer service .
723,"well , i had to , you see what he’s like .","penny ! penny , i’m hungry ."
4384,"why , what-what-what happened ?",radiation burns . a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner .
930,apology accepted .,"great . now , you’re going to love the perlmutter lecture . look , he will be stating that the universe is older than 6 , 000 years , but i thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum amazing grace during those parts ."
2909,you don’t believe in luck .,i don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky .
7420,"i grew up in a house full of crazy academics . instead of leaving santa milk and cookies , we had to leave him a research paper . and in the morning , you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded .",no wonder you love christmas . that sounds amazing .
6763,sounds like you hit the ground running . i have a bit of good news myself . my most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of neuron .,"ooh ! speaking of good news , somebody just hit 100 twitter followers ."
6416,"hey , sheldon , i’m so glad you made it . i found something i think you might like .",what i’d like is for him to have a more depressing home . this is quite lovely .
895,yeah . what did they say ?,"too bad your show is done . i kind of liked it . leonard , did you hear that ? oh , the people are heartbroken . i cant take this away from the world . fun with flags is back ."
3247,"ha ! eat my dust , racially stereotypical plumber .",that’s not fair . i got stuck behind a tree .
2326,"sorry , sheldon , it’s just not a good time for playing games .","this is a game to you ? uh , was the battle of antietam a game ? huh ? was the sack of rome a game ?"
8368,"well , yeah .","interesting . see , one more question , and perhaps i should have led with this , when did we become friends ?"
7170,why ?,"because if she hadnt , shed still be wading through the list ."
9494,maybe we should take a little break .,"good idea , i need my wrist brace , all this button pushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury ."
5038,take the bus .,i can’t take the bus any more . they don’t have seatbelts . and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords .
6450,hey .,i brought amy here to show her some of the work i’m doing .
4136,so don’t do it .,"oh , but i want to be hawking’s friend ."
9011,"i don’t know , the man on the box looks so happy .","penny ! if i’m going to buy leonard a gift , i’m going to do it right . i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did ."
1715,then i think its a terrific idea .,great . wait till you hear about our van .
1698,"ooh , what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up ?","nice . you mean , like at parks and schools ?"
9444,"oh , how kind of her .",agreed . most primates donâ€™t show that sort of discretion . a female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do ?
9306,i thought amy was gonna drive you home .,"yeah , i thought so , too , but she’s acting very strangely . i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus , and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow . although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice ."
9716,"all right , sheldon , here we go , kleingast’s field guide to north american insects . hey , toby . right here , see it ? the common field cricket , aka gryllus assimilis , which is latin for suck it , you lose .","hang on . voilà , the snowy tree cricket , aka oecanthus fultoni , which is latin for i’ll suck nothing . of course i’m joking because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo ."
7815,"oh cool , whose head did i just blow off ?",mine .
3831,"maybe . i , i don’t know . it’s late , i should , i should go . look , i do get what you’re saying . instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me , i need to work on my fear of being alone .","i was trying to suggest chemical castration , but it’s my bedtime , so whatever gets you out the door . good night ."
6299,"hey , you got snoopy out . can i have a snowcone ?","well , sure ."
3348,"uh , at least theyre talking about the theory . i mean , thats whats important .","you know , youre right . yeah . you know , its like when stan lee and steve ditko created spider-man . stan lee may get all the credit , but steve ditko knows he was just as important . even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies . and . and hes far richer . and hes a household name , you know ? whereas , you know , you say ditko , and that sounds like a company that makes dits ."
9275,he said what ?,"now , don’t be insulted . he just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious ."
985,hold on . i’ll walk down with you .,"oh , that’s not necessary . you can go first ."
1821,"okay , you listen to me . i think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend , but this is none of your business . got it ?",excuse me . this is not about protecting my friend . i’m a big fan of homeostasis . do you know what that is ?
4571,"no , no . i , i hate that puppet .","oh , no . how could anybody hate gino the neutrino ? it’s nice , huh ? i got him for 20 bucks on ebay . including the shipping !"
587,so you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back .,then i won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it .
9508,"oh , no , no , i want to . it sounds really interesting .",gentlemen .
5077,"yeah , and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts . you know , i gotta ask , why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else ?",i was otherwise engaged .
7359,"no , that was completely called for . we need quiet .","so , your project is more important than mine ?"
8029,"well , whats your plan ?","all right , my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurses office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed ."
9279,"yes . before all things , i’m a scientist . i’m just there to do my work and , with a little luck , scare the living crap out of some monkeys .",hmm . you sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself ?
9712,be careful .,"if i were not being careful , your telling me to be careful would not make me careful ."
5483,and i’m a little busy right now .,but i came to file a complaint . somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature .
7325,"so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation , but over here , you can press this , and just substitute new values for the coefficients .","good one , boss ."
7995,are you all set for your trip ?,"yeah , i think so . i just restocked the old prk ."
5514,"well , mrs . latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump .","oh , wow !"
7176,of course .,"now , before i start , i need you to know that im very excited about this , and anything you say that isnt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question . so , keep an open mind ."
8639,no .,penny . penny . penny .
5553,this is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym .,"plus , theres almost no chance well see any of our coworkers half naked ."
3557,"sheldon , i’ve given you the simplest things to do , and you haven’t done one of them right .",maybe that’s because i’m not being challenged . it’s the same reason einstein failed math .
1395,you want to fire me ?,what i want is irrelevant . this is penny’s decision . penny ?
264,how could he ruin the game ?,"given the cards that have already been played , penny can only be holding necromancer potions , which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers , and there are no more of either left to be drawn . the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire w*apon , a troll , two ogres and the jewel of osiris ."
3547,"sheldon , you’ve never worked in a lab like this before . you have no experience in the field of biology .",i have plenty of experience in biology . i bought a tamagotchi in 1998 . and it’s still alive . let’s do this .
7216,why would she even do this ?,"shes been conducting an experiment on apes where theyre given various puzzles to solve . i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldnt be able to solve them . thats when amy said , want to make this interesting ?"
6788,"yes . channel set baguettes , 20 points total weight .","remarkable . diamonds , crystallized carbon . every day , people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire . but just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly , you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars ."
3069,i said ill get to it .,"im sensing awkwardness , am i right ?"
5025,"hey , i am every bit as much of a man as penny . now , let’s do this .","wait , it’s not all pants , there’s one shirt ."
8170,"thank you , sheldon .",you’re welcome . now let’s get this over with .
3864,what did they give you ?,turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat . it’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order . in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce . they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash .
9706,"i will put up my fantastic four number 48 , first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123 , the classic flash of two worlds issue .","all right , you have a wager ."
2400,hes there .,"i dont think so . leonard cant stand yoga , the beach , massages or dancing ."
6274,like what ?,"alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl . which i’ve now just told to batman . see , i can’t keep a secret ."
8263,"i can’t decide whether i want stan lee to autograph my journey into mystery 83 , first appearance of thor or my fantastic four number five , first appearance of dr . doom . alex , i’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass ?",i’ve decided i’m going to have mr . lee sign my copy of this month’s batman .
3711,"oh , there you are . when do i get a key to our apartment ?",um…
246,aha ! so i am working with you .,"in this context , with me means for me ."
1594,"so , heads it’s ps4 , tails it’s xbox one .","all right , i’ll try ."
9436,"oh , yeah . itâ€™s an extremely competitive , cutthroat sport .","well , actually , the risk of throat cutting is very low . on the other hand , severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger ."
1529,the growing realization that you are one wacky bastard ? yep .,"no . the vibration . we are directly underneath the geology lab , and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again . hey , gravel monkeys , if you need to shake rocks , try jiggling your heads around !"
7814,"oh , what , what , what ?","this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve , there are myriad w*apon , vehicles and strategies to master , not to mention an extremely intricate back-story ."
923,"sheldon , you didn’t tell me your mom was coming .","it was in my weekly e-mail blast . right between beet season is finally here , and uh-oh , red stool from beets leads to cancer scare ."
7142,you got yourself a sleepover .,do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas ?
4364,please don’t do that .,"all right , but i’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone , it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat ."
669,i… i don’t…,"think woman , who blew their nose and when ?"
3604,"sheldon , this is not your home .","this is not anyone’s home , this is a swirling vortex of entropy ."
5108,it’s never safe .,"yeah , well , i know that now ."
1910,did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction ?,no .
8064,have you ever thought about why arthur didn’t want you to read his paper ?,"yes , i have . and my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills ."
5248,hey .,hello .
3958,sheldon lee cooper . you get back in this room right now . and bring a mop .,did you hear that ? a mop . i have two phds yet somehow i’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal .
6026,"thanks for being with us today , dr . cooper .","my pleasure , ira ."
5643,"say , betsy ross , what you working on ?",i have no idea . because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock .
2696,"all right , sheldon , your bird death ray is ready .","it’s not a death ray . it’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off . trust me , if i had a death ray , i wouldn’t be living here . i’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of earth gave me for not using my death ray . all right , and in three , two , one ."
2591,i just want to say one more thing about this . just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that were a bad couple .,"the answer is one simple test away . hmm ? you know , its like when i thought there was a possum in my closet . did i sit around wondering ? no , i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag ."
5906,"look , your anxiety levels are right in the zone .","really ? oh , thats fantastic . now , wait , theyre dropping . why are they dropping ?"
1781,"hey , stuart , come on in .",what are you doing here ?
6509,the cosmological physicist from princeton ?,"yes . and until you acquire a surgical mask , please address your comments to me through a napkin . we’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe . and now she’s under consideration for a position at our university ."
3013,"okay , why ?",im listening to you snore . im wondering how ill ever sleep without it .
2307,i might k*ll him right now .,"the dark knight has your back . he’s scared , but he has your back ."
8453,"sheldon , im not a whiner .",its amusing that he doesnt hear it .
3690,i don’t care . i don’t have to do anything you say because i don’t think i want to live here anymore .,where are you going ?
687,they texted me .,"well , as i predicted , i am sick . my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am , and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate ."
6011,"well , honey , not to complain , but we were starting to think you didn’t either .",is that really necessary ? good lord . the interference pattern in the fracture . the motion of the wave through the molecular structure . i’ve been looking at it all wrong . i can’t consider the electrons as particles . they move through the graphene as a wave . it’s a wave ! the moment to applaud would be now . troglodytes .
612,"hang on . sheldon , do you have any emotional attachment to this box ?","no , it’s a novelty i ordered off the internet . now , did you hear the click ?"
7228,"not right now , sheldon .",but i think it would be comforting .
3200,dinner’s ready !,what are we having ?
2267,"yeah , because i have something weird to tell her .",oh . i thought it was a game .
9532,"my physics bowl trophy ! “leonard is so smart , sheldon who ? ”",alright that is very immature .
6629,dr . cooper ?,yes .
4135,what are you waiting for ? hit send .,i can’t . losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest .
1898,sh**ting at a target ?,with what ?
9287,that was kind of icy . you two okay ?,"oh , we’re fine . as howard advised , she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries ."
7298,"not right now , sheldon .",but i think it would be comforting .
258,for you or with you ?,in this context for me could mean with me .
2924,what ?,it appears to be a lord of the rings ring .

4654,i don’t care . get the tardis .,yes ! this party just became a major rager .
5000,it’s not funny .,"no , oh , it actually is if you get the joke . it’s based on the premise that princeton isn’t a very good school ."

2555,well…,i believe i can answer that .
7,"oh , sonofabitch !","i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag . but returning to your key conundrum , perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you ."

1067,get that guy ! get that guy ! pew ! pew ! pew ! pew !,"dr . rostenkowski , it may interest you to know that saying pew , pew , pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key . in the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go ."

8211,"well , it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time . although , truth be told , my groin’s a little worse for wear . ow ! why did you do that ?",to send a message . she is not for you .
4542,got it .,"leonard , you’ll never guess who i just found online . hey !"
9088,"sweetheart , your little friend is concerned about you .","yes , well i’m not a child , i’m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit . and i certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother ."

6222,train day ?,"the fun starts with brunch at carney’s in studio city , a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car . next stop , travel town , an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines , cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s . finally , we’re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at , that’s right , the hollywood carney’s , a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car ."
7924,what should we do ?,we’re the justice league of america . there’s only one thing we can do . turn around and slowly walk away .

5774,have you not noticed that ive been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours ?,i just thought you were bad at the game .
6357,"but it could be part of your problem . let me give you an example . when i was eight , i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project , “do lima beans grow better to classical music . ” but my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “do lima beans grow worse to rock ‘n’ roll . ” i felt so guilty , i gave the ribbon back .",and how did that make you feel ?
4979,"okay , okay . we get it . you set the scene .",hoo !
7466,"well , seeing as its purpose was to piss you off , i’d say it’s spot-on .","all right , i see what’s going on . this is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges . well titted ."
1091,"okay , so you’d lose most of jar jar , all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings , which are like watching c-span with monsters .",get rid of the trade route part ? then how would palpatine get chancellor valorum kicked out of office ? how would he get himself elected ? how ? can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous ?
6526,"ah , dr . cooper , thank goodness . i completely forgot your address . but then i remembered that i’d written it on my hand . lucky for me , i didn’t confuse it with what i’d written on my other hand , which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star . ‘cause if i tried to go there , i’d be crushed by hypergravity . anyway , hello .",hello .
7990,"hey , have you seen koothrapali ?",he’s not here . maybe the avenger summoned him .
4627,im sure mrs . floridas walking funny . can we get back to work ?,"yeah , hes right . oh , heres a thought . what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic ?"
2324,i don’t see anything .,"give it a second to load . whenever you’re ready , at&t ! okay , here we go . this is us here . to the south is professor loomis and the geology department . according to their twitter feed , they’re out of sunblock , which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma . that’s our edge . all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge , the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them . all right , let’s move out ."
6534,"uh , sleep night . i mean , obviously , good night . i started to say sleep tight , then i changed my mind in the middle . i swear to god , i’m smart .","get it together , man ."

8786,"i don’t think that’s going to happen , sheldon .",no one ever does . that’s why it happens .
2290,what is that ?,this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard . one of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens .
1727,what ?,the ducks in my tub .
610,"what up , moon pie ?",nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw !
4666,all right .,are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis ? that wasnt a joke .
7615,what was that ?,you said be nice to penny . i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice .
8126,"okay , well , tell him i loved him on star trek .","please , leonard , stop trying to horn in on my new friends ."
343,give me one circumstance in which that would be useful .,"all right , picture this , a beautiful outdoor concert . now , as a human , i appreciate beethoven . as a fungus , i have a terrific view , growing out of a towering maple tree . and no thank you , expensive concessions . because as an algae , i’ll just snack on this sunlight ."
8085,"no , i , i , i was thinking , if it isn’t too much trouble , i’d like to get your opinion about my , my paper .",thank you . it would be an honour .
8556,"hey . howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day . now , both of you apologize right now .",she’s so tiny . it’s funny when she’s mad .
3750,"yes . well , that is a good question . but is this really the best way to figure it out ?","yeah , i agree , the social sciences are largely hokum . but , short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship , this is the best i can do ."
8648,"well , that’s every song i know . what’s up ?","you’re good friends with penny , right ?"
9069,what ?,"well think about it , it’s a product that doesn’t spoil , and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years ."
5999,"of course you don’t . mr . cooper , let me just ask you a question . what was your last job ?","senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech , focusing on m theory , or , in layman’s terms , string theory ."
3215,still right behind you .,"copy that , red five . radio contact is sufficient . no need to extend your middle finger ."
97,"oh , you admit that it’s our work .","no , once again , i’m throwing you a bone . and once again , you are welcome ."
7250,"by the power vested in us , by the state of california…",and the klingon high council…
5176,"has your , uh , assistant said anything about me ?","oh , in fact , she has . uh , her exact words were , what is that guy’s problem ?"
6165,sheldon .,yeah .
1537,"you know , if you’re trying to make space on the dvr , why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched ? like , um , alphas .","no , that’s the season two finale . that was quite the cliffhanger . i’m going to re-watch it before season three starts ."
3588,"i have 26 hundred comic books in there , i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells .",challenge accepted . we’re locked out .
8292,"darn tootin’ , i do , if the court will excuse my homespun , corn-fed nebraskan turn of phrase .",excellent . go on .
6985,what about me ?,"well , i understand there are several types of artificial women . maybe you should look into that ."
3648,"why ? because i got an ugly , itchy sweater , and my brother got a car ? no , i was her favorite .",i seem to be a few tickets short . are there more in the box ?
2657,"there’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the wound wobin , so let’s thwow down . you know , unless you’re afwaid .",we accept your challenge . name a time and place .
7143,would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up ?,"it would , but you know how much i admire preparedness . how did you know wed be in the living room ?"
1517,"oh , you are going down , cooper .","i don’t think so , kripke . i’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day ."
5061,"i said , get out .",okay . i’ll give it a sh*t .
9111,"well , wow , that’s incredible .","excuse me . thirty what , under thirty what , to watch what ?"
4624,"guys , what are we doing ? we sent the girls away so we could focus .",i dont think it worked .
4272,"well , you know how you’re always saying that amy is a girl who’s your friend , and not your girlfriend ?",uh-huh .
3669,is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing ?,"the more interesting question you should be asking is , what does this flower smell like ?"
6566,"i have two words for you . the first is big , the other’s whoop .",it is a big whoop . it made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless .
5800,now youre helping them find ways to make us miserable ?,"well , im sorry , leonard , im a problem-solver , its what i do ."
2090,"oh , too bad . i’ve always wanted to go to long beach .","it’s a very nice community . the queen mary is docked there , once the largest ocean liner in the world , it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping m*rder mystery dinner ."
6171,"im sorry , but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night .","there you go , perfect ."
572,"sheldon , we’ve been on this train 90 seconds , and you’ve already said a thousand words . just tell us where to sit and shut up .","here . i’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails , your sour disposition will abate ."
9315,what do you want ?,"amy , this isn’t easy to say . all relationships are difficult , but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions . and frankly , who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo ."
4688,"next game , lets switch helmets .","no , id look silly in that helmet ."
8840,"okay , sheldon , i think you’ve made your point .","so we multiply 193 , minus 21 men before the loss of virginity , so 172 times 0 . 18 gives us 30 . 96 sexual partners . let’s round that up to 31 ."
3062,"yeah , once he figures out how to work a door .","i was not panicked , and i am not overly attached to leonard ."
7938,"oh , no .",oh no !

6633,thank you .,"for the record , i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto ?"
8270,you’ve also got something from the pasadena municipal court .,"undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order . from left to right , it’s supposed to be federal , state , and then city of pasadena ."
7498,what ?,"amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me , i’m obligated to do something nice for you . so , yes , i’ll go to your dopey play ."
6304,"my point is , if i were a horse or a bird , i’d be very nervous around james cameron .","it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about . for example , why wasn’t william shatner in the new star trek movie ?"
8137,"anyway , after we get done snowboarding , i go back to the lodge and get in the jacuzzi . there’s no one around , so naturally , i’m free-balling it . next thing i know , this beautiful chick shows up , drunk out of her skull , wants to get in with me .",question . was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub ?
9199,to friendship .,would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking ? and the answer was elephant !
7742,yeah . he’s kind of an ass .,thank you . may i share something with you that’s troubling me ?
4479,hows that going ?,"you tell me . i feel like i cant breathe , and i am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs ."
4948,probably . i’m just enjoying the foreplay . does this mean you are done mocking my acting career ?,"oh , i’m sorry , i thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road ."
5976,"what ! what , what , what ?",leonard and penny .
370,are you set on people laughing with you ? ‘cause if you’re cool with at you…,i don’t get it .
1938,so ?,"yes , general tso ."
8182,"oh , sheldon , am i glad you’re back . taking a turn for the worst . i think i’m going to need another bath .","i’m surprised to hear that . see , the other day , i was concerned that you weren’t recovering , so while you were sleeping , i took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab ."
1753,nothing . the engine does that sometimes .,"that can’t be nothing , the check engine light is on . we need to find a service station ."
3670,i’m gonna go with sad . so what’s the story with you and this dvd ?,"there’s nothing to tell . maybe i purchased a book entitled don’t sweat the small stuff and i followed its wise suggestions , one of which was stop and smell the flowers ."
3652,"okay , sheldon , i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago , and i know we rented it on your card . but it’s been , like , seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened . so in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are , what if this one time you just tried staying calm ?","that seems like a reasonable request . although so did , hey , leonard , would you mind returning that dvd ?"
5201,"sheldon , that’s incredible .","yeah , i know . they called it the greatest thing since the communist party . although i’m pretty sure that the communist party made them say that . i like china . see , they know how to keep people in line ."
7482,"um , well , i’m from nebraska . so what can you tell me about the state flag ?","gosh , penny , what’d you have for breakfast ? a big glass of good question juice ? the nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue . spread your legs , invite them in ."
2361,no .,fine . bad .
4260,"from a neurobiological standpoint , leonard , you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation .","did you know that , leonard ?"
5432,what ?,nothing . i said nothing .
6285,"c’mon raj , how am i supposed to know who she’s attracted to . or was attracted to . or who she might be attracted to . in the future .","and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation . because i too know absolutely nothing about priya’s preferences in male companionship . and with that , i will re-zip my lip ."
4991,"mrs . cooper , hey , it’s penny . yeah , i think i broke your son . hey , hold on . talk to your mother .","mommy , i love you . don’t let spock take me to the future !"
7189,"anyway , thanks again . cooper , suck eggs .",since when do you help out barry kripke ?
9220,we agweed to exchange copies of our work . let me see yours .,why don’t you show me yours first .
3737,"mmm , gentlemen , i put it to you , the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour .","first off , that is axiomatically wrong , because the best pudding is chocolate . secondly , the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death . it is extracted from the plant…"
7109,a what ?,"a naked man sat on it . now , here’s my concern , his diet is rich in fatty deli meats . what test do you have to detect lipid residue ?"
9246,you ever going to sleep with amy ?,that’s awfully personal .
8254,"well , i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things theyd never say to your face .",interesting . i cant think of a single thing i wouldnt say to someones face .
8028,"uh , im just gonna be honest with the guy .",honesty will never get us in .
5591,"yeah , more cutbacks .",unacceptable . it baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research .
1171,really ? would it be totally weird if i used it ?,yes .
7510,"…when i was a very young girl . when i was 16 years old , i made the discovery , love . all at once , and much , much too completely . it was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow . that’s how it struck the world for me . but i was unlucky . deluded .",she’s remarkable .
7649,"that long , huh ?",60 only takes me to here . i need to get to here .
1422,she didn’t dump me . we were just in different places in the relationship .,i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location .
6782,glad i could help .,"it’s appreciated . and if you ever manage to find a woman again , i’ll be glad to return the favour ."
9203,i’ve been up all night . i had a fight with bernadette .,why ?
7699,you might not want to do that .,i assure you i do .

8927,forget it .,"so , you can experiment on all the apes you want . but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings , suddenly im the monster ."
874,that was a good one .,it was so good .
2297,you got one for good luck . i’ll get it .,one for good luck . must be the kind of math they do at princeton .
2643,"if you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place , you’d be happy all the time .","uh , penny , i , i have a couple of questions about your closet . is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish ?"

1719,come in ! hurry !,penny ?
5347,"hey , buddy .",hello .
5932,"sheldon , i want you to take that cap off .","that nagging tone is helping my anxiety , yeah . but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill , thatd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah ."
840,i’m calling him .,"oh , goodie , put him on speaker phone ."

1641,"excuse us for a second . sheldon , it’s okay , he can do it . he’s a barber .","he’s not a barber , he’s the nephew . he’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry . besides , mr . d’onofrio knows exactly how i like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in texas ."
2014,"well , it’s always me , take one for the team .","i have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will , and then you came along and reshaped him , with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals ."

9209,no .,don’t waste my time .
7342,what are you doing ?,"oh . good morning , shoemaker . i think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night ."
4713,that is no way to speak to your mother .,"perhaps not . but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life , and then desecrates one of ethan allen’s finest sofas ."
875,oh . we were just talking about how much we love working with you . isnt that right ? dan ?,"over the years here at fun with flags , weve had an opportunity to learn , laugh , wonder ."

6868,does she work in a similar field to you ?,"ha . the opposite . she’s a neurobiologist , and i’m a theoretical physicist . my spirit guides can go suck an egg ."
4643,not really .,"oh , well ."
5080,"the application in your hand , give it to her .",oh .
5783,"yeah . if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country , do you know what they would have said ?",that i couldnt do it ?
8903,"now , the first thing you have to know about shelly is ever since he was a little boy , he was always concerned with the well-being of others . and he didnt think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity , so he was gonna power the entire town for free .",tell her about the uranium . tell her about the uranium .
7205,"i dont know , just think about something else .",can i think about the spiny anteater ?
7604,"we did , but there were extenuating circumstances .",i see . did her abysmal housekeeping k*ll finally trump her perkiness ?
7337,"again , right now it’s just a dummy procedure , but eventually , it will drop us into…",i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership .
9197,monkeys .,when does a monkey have a trunk ?
2856,and go where ?,it doesn’t matter .
1861,oh . sorry . i don’t know your sad song .,i don’t have a sad song . i’m not a child .
2659,"sheldon , we have to call it off .","we don’t have that option , we’ve accepted the challenge . we can’t run away from a fight ."
3384,yes .,"okay . that was tricky , cause when it comes to alcohol , she generally means business ."
9321,i have to get a lock for my door .,"i think you’ll like the drill tonight . i’ve tried to make it fun . each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event . everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by canada . pick a catastrophe , any catastrophe ."

6404,a floppy disk ?,"well , i started the list when i was nine ."
8065,"maybe he found you , um , a bit much .","that’s kind of a stretch . look , when it comes to social k*ll , i’ve mastered the big three . there’s the coy smile . there’s the friendly chuckle . there’s the vocalization of sympathy . aw . that last one’s tricky , i’m still working on it ."
7060,"of course i understand . sheldon , theres something else ive been wanting to say , but before i do , i just , i want you to know that you dont have to say it back . i know youre not ready , and i dont want you to say it just because social convention dictates…","i love you , too ."
2096,i’ve got a solution .,"great , what is it ?"
2003,are you really gonna sit here all day ?,"think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy , lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home ."
8187,i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie .,"oh , that seems overly harsh . i mean , you gave in to a human weakness , you didn’t k*ll a man . you know , it’s a tad old-school , but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey ."
8526,section 5,feel free to retain a lawyer .
9235,"what did you do , put this in your tea ?","oh , dear . now i’m not even smarter than you ."
5017,yes .,"nice try . now , element lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements . helium has an atomic number of two . if you multiply that by the atomic number of n , nitrogen , you get 14 , which is the atomic number of ? i’m just funnin’ you , silicon . and that is the most common element in the earth’s surface . so that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab ."
546,"oh , that’s me .",did you let wil wheaton get in your head ?
1449,what ?,it’s a time of day i invented . it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening . preevning . i’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need .
8021,"well , so do i , but theyll never let us .",is that the attitude that helped you get penny ?
6900,i just want to say one more thing about this . just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that were a bad couple .,"the answer is one simple test away . hmm ? you know , its like when i thought there was a possum in my closet . did i sit around wondering ? no , i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag ."
2610,juggle .,you health nuts k*ll me .
1900,"i’m not going to do that , sheldon .","leonard , the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience . we have to do our part , too . that was uncalled for , but i’ll play along . ow ! i had an unusual experience with amy last night ."
3920,i know what the anthropic principle is .,"of course . i just explained it to you . now , where do you stand on it ?"
2757,yes sir .,"you can count on us , we’re on it . what the hell do you mean , dead end ."
6124,ugh ! ugh ! ugh ! ugh !,penny ?
6397,who’s mohammed lee ?,"mohammed is the most common first name in the world , lee , the most common surname . as i didn’t know the answer , i thought that gave me a mathematical edge ."
1885,and that is your opinion .,i forgive you . let’s go home .
9573,leave .,what is your problem ?
5738,"night . attaboy , hofstadter . nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies . hey , i’m back .",cut ! take 47 .
8442,were gonna set a date .,okay . if you say so .
5890,"oh , im just doing this awful workout . i hate it .","well , if you hate it , then why are you doing it ? although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard ."
2097,get out .,"fine . i’ve hesitated to point this out , but i must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit . i’m just trying to clean up after your mess . we’ll talk in the morning ."
9051,how come you didn’t go into work today .,"i’m taking a sabbatical , because i won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds ."
5692,"all right , yeah , i’ll play along . what was my first strike ?",march 18th . you violated my rule about forwarding email humour .
499,"big or small , i don’t like rabbits . they always look like they’re about to say something , but they never do .","rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size . and on a side note , they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis ."
5624,"yeah , well , before they went out of business , i bought 4 , 000 containers . i keep them in the trunk of my car .","but . oh , this changes everything ."

8651,"yes , i am .",penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building .
2171,"okay , feel better , bye . she doesn’t want to talk .","not surprising . penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala , while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex . the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless . or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk ."
8994,what difference does it make ?,the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators .
5678,i asked .,what did they say ?
8947,"well , not to steal from the bible , but turning water into wine sounds pretty good .",i dont think youre taking this seriously .
398,"oh , i have to go to the bathroom so bad .","every year . i told you , wear a diaper ."
2010,"give it a chance , sheldon , you might actually like it .",you’re absolutely right . nope .
5166,maybe i could do it .,"you , really ? you can assess the quality of my work ? okay , um , here . i wrote this when i was five years old ."
5871,"oh , that is not true .",i’ve got to go with leonard on this . he is wrong more than anyone i know .
9542,"before you get upset , i believe i’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy .","people usually start a meeting with a joke , but you go ahead , end with one ."
1283,"okay , simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three , two , one .",fascinating .
8157,"why would it trouble you ? it’s , like , your third favourite cartoon theme song .","it is , right behind do-do-do-do-do inspector gadget . , and teenage mutant ninja turtles , heroes in a half-shell ."
2448,that’s nice .,"oh , that’s a rather earthy cologne . my uncle used to wear that . perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before leonard returns ."
4256,i don’t know . maybe .,i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your well-being .
1836,what’s your point ?,call me a romantic . i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere .
9351,"sheldon , i’m working . i can’t take you to the dentist . also , and i can’t stress this enough , i don’t want to take you to the dentist .","can’t help a friend out in a time of need , huh ? i see where your therapist was coming from ."
1019,"okay , when you say seeing penny , what exactly does that mean ?","we had dinner last night . she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it . well , little hot dog . i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog . a real , big dog . a hell hound . tangential to the primary story . how about i circle back to it ?"

1326,"sheldon , how is that a fight pose ?",mr . data’s w*apon is his mind . i’m wielding it .

8574,"well , i just , i thought…","if i can interject here , obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate ."
1651,"you know , sheldon , i used to cut my brother’s hair . i could do it for you .","penny , i know you mean well , offering the k*ll of the hill folk , but , um , here in town we don’t churn our own butter , we don’t , uh , make dresses out of g*n sacks , and , uh , we sure as sh**t’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
9365,"s’mores , huh ? good for you .","yes , or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement ."
1169,should i say something ? i feel like i should say something .,"you ? no , you’ll only make it worse ."
2528,"hey , you’re in a good mood .",i’m in a great mood .
1206,"thank you sheldon , you’re a good friend .",and you’re certainly not going to win a nobel prize .
6256,sounds great .,excellent choice .
7499,"hey , i don’t want you to go any more .",why not ?
5469,i’m missing something . did you say something to penny about alex ?,"oh , yes . yeah , and a fat lot of good it did me . all she did was get mad at you ."
9145,you’re welcome .,what took you so long ?
431,why don’t you and your friends come to comic-con with me ?,really ?
7281,"sheldon , this isnt that hard .",i may have a better way that you can teach me .
867,thank you . how about a hug ?,how about a hearty handshake ?
2974,problem ?,"yes , he won’t let go of my comic book ."
5236,yes . it’s my water .,"well , that’s it then . i’m dead ."
5093,what ?,"statistically , red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour . i don’t want any hassles with the fuzz ."
5433,i dunno . i just think itâ€™s a waste . relax . iâ€™m just looking at the box .,"perhaps you should look with your eyes , and not your muscular nebraska man-hands ."
541,"that’s right , sheldon . embrace the dark side .",that’s not even from your franchise !
5195,sheldon ?,zone .
1132,hi .,hi .
9587,"oh , my god , you’re jealous .",why would i be jealous ?
4501,"no , you’re right . no , there’s , there’s no plots , no trucks , no feet . so what other annoying habits shall we discuss ?","uh , we don’t discuss anything . leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement . as such , he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines ."
6354,how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale ?,i was wearing size a million pants .
9095,"well , i’m done fishing . you put those on .",what for ?
3390,"lets forget about them , and pick ourselves out a nice turtle . oh , how about this one up on the log ?","oh , i dont know . he kind of looks like a jerk . how about this one ?"
3888,"no ! i don’t want to try it , my god , you are grown men , how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…","again , time machine ."
2962,"you got me . while you’re there , could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday ?",i think you mean comic books . comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages .
4155,great .,good . i’m glad .
3259,"oh , come on ! a smart guy like you , it’ll be a challenge . you can make it like an experiment .","interesting . i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla , i could teach you some rudimentary physics ."
7919,and the award for best group costume goes to justice league of america number three !,thank you ! thank you so much !
6034,are you really admitting defeat ?,i never admit defeat .
9645,nope . its pretty exciting .,arent you afraid of being blinded ?
9682,"tech support , can i help you ?","yes , its a robot uprising . call the police ."
2583,some perfect couple . he wont even share his food with her .,it has avocado on it . shes allergic to avocado . are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die ?
2813,"she’s just so impossible , they keep quitting .","so , who’s watching her now ?"
3959,"hey , sheldon .",hello .
2947,"yeah , meemaw did the nasty .",i said stop it !
6643,"yes , well , let’s talk about it anyway .",i don’t want to . not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars .
5174,"sheldon , aren’t you going to introduce us ?",no . i have people for that now . you’re up .
6841,aw . what’s wrong with her ?,"well , she talks a lot . she always wants to hold hands ."
7967,why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra ?,"well , why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves ."
3586,"excuse me , your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman’s flight is a feat of strength .","are you listening to yourself , it is well established that superman’s flight is a feat of strength , it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings , an ability he derives from earth’s yellow sun ."
8991,nevertheless we are… .,in addition i really don’t think that leonard wants a…
9576,sheldon .,"let’s see . what’s next ? oh , kissing’s romantic ."
2563,thats so cool . congratulations . i guess that makes you the athlete of the group .,"well , not just him . may i remind you that youre talking to the seeker , b*at , chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team ."
2630,absolutely .,"if i say yes , can we turn off that latin orgy music ?"
3190,"yeah , that’s very comforting .","comforting is a part of leadership . it’s not a part i care for , but such is my burden ."
7355,we’re actually scanning equations and getting good results .,"oh , well then , by all means , carry on . i wouldn’t want to impede your progress ."
8027,"were trying to get past a security guard , not rescue zelda .","i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy , but one quest at a time . so whats the plan ?"
5036,and ?,i didn’t . let’s go .
1080,"yeah , um , of all the things about this that are sad , that might not be number one . you okay ? i know he meant a lot to you .",i’m fine .
4283,"ah , you’re going off the grid .",exactly .
7562,"sorry . okay , who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar ?",i want oatmeal .
7085,you don’t need a parking space . you don’t have a car .,you don’t need an iron man helmet . you’re not iron man .
2085,"so she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena , when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach ?",un-unravelable .
6345,"yeah , so ?",that’s a lot of money for only one colour .
2452,well…,"i’m quite familiar with plumbing . not to brag , but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet ."
4966,what ?,it’s the only explanation i can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt .
2023,of course not . this is just leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship . he’s manipulating you like he always does .,"wait , wait , now , hang on . you think he manipulates me ?"
7635,you’re not changing how penny laughs .,"no , that would be incongruous , i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register ."
8753,"sheldon , honey , i’ve told you , it’s a small apartment , you only have to knock one time .","please , please , i don’t have a lot of time . look , ramona finally dozed off , and i need you to help me get rid of her ."
8493,i thought you didnâ€™t like facebook anymore .,donâ€™t be silly . iâ€™m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact .
226,i’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you .,for me .
1013,"oh , just come in !",thanks for seeing me on such short notice .
6679,"oh , yeah , you know , every bartender makes it differently . why don’t you give it a try .",all right . to the metric system . i can’t taste the cherries .
1929,agreed . it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared .,"i must say , amy , pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction ."
8163,"what about you , sheldon ? do you have any plans tonight ?","sadly , yes . amy’s taking me to a memorial service . it’s for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent , so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave , he’ll never make his way back to china ."
5251,my mirth . classic .,is there a station coming up where i can board your giggling train of thought ?
1404,"oh , god , we’re never gonna finish in time . who made sheldon the boss anyway ?",i believe i’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor .
2179,i was just wondering if i could talk to you ? it’s about leonard .,why me ? why not koothrappali or wolowitz ?
697,"how could you have gotten it from me , i’m not sick .",you’re a carrier . all these people here are doomed . you’re doomed !
1124,"i don’t know , i’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before .",let’s try just walking out .
3895,what was your first clue ?,"well , it was a number of things . first the late hour , then your demeanour seems very low energy , plus your irritability…"
7799,"you mean , like in bed or in the shower ?","no ! would you please stop referencing that infernal book ? for example , this morning , i was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum , when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale , slightly hunched shoulders . oh , what has that vixen done to me , leonard ? and how do i make it stop ?"
5110,rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust .,you saw nothing !
1778,what are you doing ?,i am talking to a man in space . if you don’t have the then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street .
7363,"something got you down , there , sheldon ?",leonard kicked me out of my own apartment . and his app team .
2634,"we were all thinking it , really . it was kind of the elephant in the room , so…","anyway , um , i realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you , only one of which is true , and then we don’t tell you which one it is , you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence ."
7187,did you know edison didnt actuawy invent the wight bulb ?,"what do you want , barry ?"
3489,"uh , ive got some bad news . theres no cell service in here .","oh . well , thats all right . there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented ."
7885,what would i even say ?,"zack , i’m sorry you’re stupid . have a milk dud ."
1037,you use it to get your way .,i use it to get the right way . the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence .
6093,i think she meant something a little happier .,"i suppose we could try to make it a celebration , but he died so young ."
2256,i’m suggesting there might be something you could do about amy’s urges ?,it’s illegal to spay a human being .
7745,i trained ricky how to smoke . i can train him to sh**t a poison dart . no jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys .,"i understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild , but i really need to talk to smart amy now ."
2613,"if i wanted to know , i would’ve opened it years ago . the closet looks great . let’s get out of here .","wait , can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride ?"
313,good night .,"leonard , there’s one more thing . under article one , section three of our roommate agreement , i’m calling an emergency meeting ."
2649,"yeah , well , it almost k*ll me .","if it wanted to k*ll you , you’d be dead ."
2281,"hi . fellas . hey , can i get a beer ? wow . look at you . little leonard hofstadter . i hear you’re a big-time scientist now .",and there’s the first zinger . ouch .
6741,come on .,can i at least kick down the door ?
2979,no .,all right . then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening ?
2547,"okay , barry , that’s enough .","no , no , no , that’s okay . i can fight my own battles . isn’t that right , bawwy ."
5512,"yes , sheldon . keep watching .","you know , it’s a shame , all that work she’s doing to get sober , only to be torn apart and eaten alive ."
5132,"erase all the hard drives , scrap the surveillance tapes , wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run .",why wasn’t that plan a ?
2159,please .,you got the wrong mustard .
7080,sheldon ?,cookie .
3137,you went to president seibert’s house in the middle of the night ?,"he didn’t respond to my e-mail , his phone number is unlisted . tell me what my other option was ."
8845,you’re still on that ?,"in these uncertain times , doesn’t humanity deserve a gift ?"
5850,i guess it didn’t go well .,we don’t know that . not to a certainty . all we know is that leonard is home .
9613,"that doesn’t work any more . he just thinks i’m taking him to the doctor . so , now that you’re no longer invested in string theory , what are you gonna pursue ?","oh , there are so many exciting areas . black holes , dark matter ."
6445,"okay , let me just get right to it . amy is judgmental , sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious .",so ?
3967,where’d you go ?,"my mother asked me to get some towels . i took advantage of the vague request and went to bed , bath & beyond . excuse me , i’m on the phone . so rude ."
1428,sheldon ! play nice .,well it’s not a great question . how could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon ? that’s a great question .
8203,"rough night , casey jones ?",you don’t know the half of it . it was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes . but it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying h-o starter sets .
2520,"amy said you were having a rough time , and i thought maybe we could talk . is that okay ?","certainly . although , right now , i’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room , and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque ."
7412,done ?,i think the word you’re looking for is bravo .
4969,"so , did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you ?",yes . i didn’t care for it .
1855,"okay , can someone please tell me what’s going on here ?","what’s going on is i was led to believe i was making groundbreaking strides in science , when in fact , i was being fed false data at the hands of wolowitz , koothrappali and your furry little boy toy ."
8408,i still don’t know why you left .,i can’t tell you .
5602,here we go .,"that is my spot . in an ever-changing world , it is a single point of consistency . if my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional cartesian coordinate system , that spot at the moment i first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero ."
9616,yeah .,"i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band . of course , i’d be the dreamy one and the smart one ."
448,the kids are gonna love him .,i cant believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is whats in their diapers .
7625,"no , i don’t want any chocolate ! sheldon , you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat .","actually , it turns out i can ."
1284,"well , they’ve deployed our solution . let’s just all hope it works .","i don’t see why i have to worry . my career’s not hanging in the balance . that was a joke . it’s funny , because it’s true ."
5995,good .,one question .
7472,what are you doing in there ?,i’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas . just a little experiment in pest control .
3727,"well , what is it , then ? i did everything just the way you like it .",you did .
361,hmm . can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation ?,"we can , but thanks to steve jobs , we don’t have to ."
6279,"oh , i’m so sure i’m going to regret this , but , who was i with ?","the fun loving , and morally loose , miss maggie mcgeary ."
5230,"howie , that was amazing . look , i’m shaking .","she’s sick , i knew it . bye ."
8709,"yup , i’m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist .",you tell people i’m a rocket scientist ?
8933,the worlds greatest mom is in the shoe compartment .,you ready to begin ?
6251,"okay , he’s in the bathroom , let’s go .",do you prefer ointment or cream ?

9158,you want to breed a new friend ?,"that’s one option , but who has the time ? but consider this , the japanese , they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence , now , you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at disney , next thing you know , we’re playing halo with a multi-lingual abraham lincoln ."
488,"sheldon , i promise . your uvula does not have an std .",are you sure ? it just doesnt feel as innocent as it used to .
3230,"yeah , hi .","all right , why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic ."
8296,but it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you . totally .,maybe you should put on your juicy pants again .
9525,denied .,informal protest .
8497,"hereâ€™s a radical thought . go old-school , challenge stuart to a fight . i mean , nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed .",and unfriend howard wolowitz .
8426,"oh , your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals .",been there .
4783,what ?,"while unlikely , it’s still a statistical possibility . she might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it ."
5208,what’s wrong ?,i’ve made a horrible mistake .
7848,we can’t order chinese food without wolowitz ?,"let me walk you through it , our standard is , the steamed dumpling appetizer , general so’s chicken , beef with broccoli , shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main . do you see the problem ?"
3232,i’d like to weigh in here . no .,"all right , why don’t we open it up to q&a from the audience ?"
5704,"there you go , quesadilla , salad , there’s your pizza , and thanks to sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger , barbecue sauce , bacon and cheese on the side .",thank you .
9393,"yes , it occurs to me , too .",hang on a moment . here . take some . pay me back when you can .
703,no .,then surprise me . would you call that moss green or forest green ?
5105,"i wonder a lot of things about you , sheldon , but not… not that .","well , those are indicators that i’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human ."
8661,"it’s because you have no measurable sense of humour , shelly .",how exactly would one measure a sense of humour ? a humourmometer ?
3291,not great . they hired divorce attorneys .,"you know , speaking of attorneys , if i ever needed a lawyer , i would not hire she-hulk ."
3673,"okay , sheldon , i am out of options . video store owner , nursis manookian , has no next of kin .","well , you seem hot under the collar , or is that the sweater ?"
2408,youre all alike .,"well , what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling . like , i cant always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me . you know , like , uh , if theyre mad at something ive done or just in a bad mood . it , its incredibly stressful ."
9336,there . done .,"all right . that’s it . we are now no longer companions , boon or otherwise . we are now merely acquaintances . to amend the words of toy story , you have not got a friend in me ."
1327,stop !,stealing is against the law !
9385,"sheldon , would you be prepared , on a non-precedential basis , to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency ?","oh , leonard , you know i can’t do that ."
5773,i dont care .,"wrong . hunts . hey , amy , what do you say ? you ready to move on to the mustard round ?"
6095,stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in .,you know those confounded things make me dizzy .
5406,"iâ€™m sorry , you are our resident cut-up ?",yes .
8431,"well , sheldon , when youre kissing a girl , she expects the attention to be on her .",it was . i asked her if she thought i should watch the flash .
9262,"so , you’re okay with this ?","well , why wouldn’t i be ?"
9489,okay . what artificial satellite has seen glimpses of einsteins predicted frame dragging ?,and of course it’s gravity probe b .

1863,"well , no , but when i was a senior in high school , one of my friends heard i was going to be named head cheerleader . oh , i was so excited . my mom even made me a celebration pie . then they named stupid valerie mossbacher head cheerleader . big ol’ slutbag .",are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize ?
986,or we could go together .,i can’t think of a reason why not .
4683,"no , because i liked it .","well , now , dont get defensive . youre oddly-shaped , but you got the girl ."
3952,"hey , how’s your sister ?",<i>she went into labor an hour ago .
6887,"yeah , toddlers do that .",not as well as we do .
8999,too late .,"let’s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you , it’s a laborious activity , because i have to imagine what you need , whereas you know what you need . now i can simplify things , just give you the fifty dollars directly and , you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday , and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer . and i ask you , is it worth it ?"
8828,"well , why don’t you tell her ?",all right . it was hell .
7705,can i see the roommate agreement ?,"um , it’s fairly technical ."
8467,"oh , uh , clear nail polish . i had a mani-pedi . men can get those . anyway , i may owe you an apology .",there’s doubt ?
4049,what’s this ?,read it .
6257,"right , right , alright .",priya ?
3485,"it does , somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it .","well , once again , its what i do ."
6089,"‘cause im a liar , liar ?",thats for the fire marshal to determine .
2474,"sheldon , you cannot just barge in here like that .",right . penny . penny . penny . are you going to answer the door or should i open it and say aha again ?
9634,"ugh . me , too . what happened ?",i drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for stephen hawking .
5238,you guys ready to order ?,"yes , i’d like a seven-day course of penicillin , some , uh , syrup of ipecac , to induce vomiting , and a mint ."
6454,"i’m sorry , i’m-i’m still trying to work on the defecating clark maxwell , so…","excuse me , but a grand unified theory , insofar as it explains everything , will ipso facto explain neurobiology ."
7360,"well , seeing as your project is to sabotage my project , yes .","don’t b*at around the bush , leonard . if you don’t want me here , just say the word , and i’ll leave ."
3873,sheldon ?,yeah .
1198,this is it . i’ll do the talking .,"good thinking , i’ll just be the muscle ."
4181,"i’m uncomfortable , sheldon !","thank you , that’s very helpful ."
1518,"congratulations , sheldon . you win office .",who’s unsatisfactory in p . e . now ?
8836,"whoa , wait , wait , wait . i did not start dating at 15 .",i’m sorry . 16 ?
5477,"well , according to ms . jensen , you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich . i don’t even know what that means , but i’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it .","oh ! i see the confusion here . no , no , alex thought i was singling her out . no . i meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges , you know ? even you . you’re a slave ."
7519,i didn’t do anything . i was just sitting here .,"i wasn’t referring to this evening . ten years ago , upon first seeing me , your husband claimed that i looked like c-3po and pee-wee herman . and he called me c-3p-wee herman ."
6812,"oh , cool . can i play ?",it’s three-person chess . did you bring a friend ?
1799,"yes , please , penny will k*ll me .","uh , fine . fyi , secret-keeping ? hate it . hand-holding ? not a fan . hammerhead shark ? i love that thing . yeah , it’s another fish with a tool on its head ."
1014,"what do you want , sheldon ?",maybe this isn’t a good time .
128,"i’ve had enough of your condescension . maybe i didn’t go to college when i was eleven like you , maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 , but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room . no offense . and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation .",so you admit that you’re an egotist ?
1364,that’s all ?,before taxes .
8503,whatâ€™s up ?,i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me .
7175,thats how much buying a comic book store means to me .,id like your honest opinion on something .
4470,but youre okay with superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses ?,he doesnt just put on a pair of glasses . he combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality .
891,hey .,hello .
2793,"sheldon , there’s a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering .","and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you , bubbula . but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes ."
1969,"look , sheldon , sweetie , i know you’re feeling insecure , but we’ve really got to go to sleep .",all right . i’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400 .
5455,"it’s your assistant alex , isn’t it ?",no . no . no . this is tondelaya della ventimiglia .
4403,this is a door knob .,it’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat .
8534,sheldon .,"ugh , fine , i’ll go . but if her food is delicious , thanksgiving is ruined , and it’s on you ."
5757,oh .,"2530 east andy devine avenue ,"
6527,nice to finally meet you in person .,"i would imagine it is . this is my friend and roommate , dr . leonard hofstadter ."
6294,you put moths in my food ?,for science .
3923,i’m all for it .,attaboy !
5413,awesome !,"look , it was actually designed for my vintage mr spock action figure ."
7595,of course .,thank you .
8987,"okay , here’s the deal , we are going to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday .","i hardly think so , leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party ."
3249,"hey , sheldon , can i talk to you for a second ?","it’s not about shoes , is it ? i don’t think i could go through that again ."
6570,"come on , it’s just a video game . and we suck at it .",nice motivational speech from the team captain .
6638,that’s really not the sort of thing we’re interested in .,"you heard me say blu-ray , right ?"
7351,we’re not quitting on leonard .,i understand . and your loyalty is admirable . but what if i were to up the ante ?
8936,"question one . ""given the choice of anyone in the world , whom would you want as a dinner guest ? """,hmm . living or dead ?
8518,interesting . now try it without the quadruple negative .,youâ€™re being impossible .
1208,really ? great .,"thank you . you’re not done with her , are you ?"
3868,you lucky duck .,"i wonder why no-one else bid , this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia ."
7473,"it’s not gonna work , dude , i grew up in india , an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street , and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement .","well , we’ll just see how long you can hold out ."
9205,yes .,talk to him .
4065,yeah .,"well , i don’t think you have a sh*t there . i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs . now , given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability ."
9296,"i can’t leave now , sheldon . i’m very busy . besides , why would i want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria ? image number four , boa constrictor .",what on earth are you talking about ? my behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful . maybe your friend g*n needs to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humour .
7978,"oh , hey guys . you having a good time ?","given the reaction to my costume , this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system ."
8448,great .,you still didnt pick a date .
1239,what ?,i’ve never knocked on my own door before . that was a wild ride .
2289,i think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit .,a little bit ? the man super glued hershey’s kisses to your nipples .
2740,we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla and play real-life operation .,no .
275,but this is other money .,how does it different from the money i have ?
4585,"thank you , sheldon . that , that was very nice .",want me to sing it again ?
1035,she’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up .,she’s 93 . she won’t be disappointed for very long .
1229,"fifteen’s the point , the point is fifteen . give the little lady some room , here it is , coming out . sixteen ! yes ! oh , please tell me we’re playing for money .","oh , even better than money . you gained experience points ."
6834,"yeah . sounds like me . come on , sheldon . what do you say ?",all right . i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday .
1008,"hey , where you been ?","i told you , walking ."
5280,yep .,is this your card ?
6980,"yes , actual women are the best .",i don’t understand . what other kind of women are there ?
5178,yes .,half a teaspoon of sprinkles ?
3828,eleven .,how many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion ?
2532,"no , it’s all over .",i can’t believe it .
4293,i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother .,"no misunderstanding . i’ve learned what that request actually means , and i don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis ."
1058,"i think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today . not only do you get to meet my relatives , but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party , all of the food is incredibly soft . it’s like a vacation for your teeth .",all right .
6262,no-one’s going to ask if i spent the night with raj’s sister .,perhaps . but they might ask me something else .
7168,you say things like that all the time .,"yes , but as a store owner , ill finally have a good comeback to , you dont work here , shut up ."
8369,you could be batman ?,sure . i’m batman . see .
281,"oh , i’m sorry , did i rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself ?","you don’t understand . growing up , i idolized wil wheaton ? wesley crusher had an eidetic memory just like me ."
1043,"hmm . oh , have this collectors edition batman utility belt . maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy .","well , she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume ."
1316,"well , then why are you going ?","it’s a comic book convention . you know , it’s like pizza or particle accelerators , even the stinky one’s still pretty good ."
6654,how about that gorn sitting on the couch ?,"that seems fairly conclusive . no , gorn , no . that’s where i sit ."
968,mmm . how’s leonard doing ?,"he seems all right . although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on . oh , but now that i think of it , he asked me not to tell you that ."
7809,"bonjour mademoiselle , i understand you’re new in town .",oh good grief .
2381,and then they finish it off by staring into each others eyes for four minutes .,"oh , thats nonsense . i proclaimed my love for you . and the last time i looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis ."
3953,that’s wonderful . so you’re at the hospital ?,"no , she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the stone age and a cave wasn’t available ."
1939,"not tso the chicken , so the question . so ?","so , why is it no longer a specialty ? did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself ? and look over here , shrimp in mobster sauce . what is mobster sauce ?"
8243,did he respond yet ?,"hmm . no , not yet ."
1274,"of course you feel terrible . you completely screwed up your karma , dude .","you don’t really believe in that superstition , do you ?"
619,really ?,i like it . i think youre on to something .
8283,whoa ! what do you mean all ?,"well , you’re my friends . you’ll be standing by my side , supporting me , feeding me legal precedents , and if you had the upper body strength , carrying me out on your shoulders when i’m victorious ."
1742,i don’t want you to see me naked .,"oh . well , that’s understandable . you may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology . uh , lot and his wife , perseus and medusa , orpheus and eurydice ."
1390,i’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen .,wow .
2203,"sheldon , i think i’ve made a mistake .","i can see that . unless you’re planning on running a marathon , choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy ."
5943,"now , you just get comfortable .","no , no , comfort is the enemy . you know whats comfortable ? slippers and blankets and panda bears . imagine a panda bear with richard feynmans face on it . warm up the car , leonard , its poster time ."
1579,"uh , xbox one .",penny ?
1655,"well , this isn’t a crisis . why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little ?","why don’t i let my hair grow out ? um , why don’t i start wearing birkenstocks and , uh , uh , seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it ?"
3568,what do you want ?,"i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory . after all , i did book the whole week ."
2352,probably not .,barely knew him .
2212,tell me whether or not to go through with the date .,schrodinger’s cat .
7371,why not ?,"oh , penny , where do i begin ? the simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality ."
6116,"ooh , and one time when you were asleep , amy totally took off her . . . and thats why youre the best roommate ever .","aw , now im sad i didnt hear it ."
9715,what would you name him ?,"an appropriate cricket name . for example , jiminy ."
6052,hello .,"hey , how did it go ?"
3178,for this i went to mit .,and begin .
3192,not exactly . but she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this .,what is it ?
1307,"so , you think shell be single soon ?","oh , if you want to get in on the pool , youre too late . all the squares have been purchased ."
6099,"okay , the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass .","the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him , and no one else was ."
7029,how is this helpful ?,all the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one . that means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground . now theres a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef .
575,thank you .,"of course , if skynet actually did exist in the future , a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send terminators back posing as actors who have played terminators in popular films and television series , lulling us into a false sense of security , i . e . , that’s summer glau from the sarah connor chronicles . no , summer , don’t k*ll me ! i’m pro-robot ! ahh !"
6656,was your statement untrue ?,no .
7115,something happened different from the way you wanted it .,"i guess news travels fast . its true , a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman , and i wasnt included ."
8572,"no , he doesn’t .",i understand . you dispute newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top .
6276,"kind of busy here , sheldon .","i know , that’s why i shortened it ."
8750,not if he wants a nobel prize .,he does want that . does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends ?
5897,"okay , well do it .",done .
5724,"can i sit wherever i want ? no , no , never mind , never mind , that’s , that’s not important . sheldon , this was big of you . thank you . i really appreciate it .",thank you .
269,"oh , damn it . can i have a napkin ?","i’m sorry , no ."
629,"wow , its all happening so fast . should we just sleep on it ?","we could , but we always run the risk of someone else b*at us to the punch ."
3081,the kids are gonna love him .,i cant believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is whats in their diapers .
3466,"okay , i’m sorry .","well , that was a long bus ride for not very much ."
6430,all right . i like a good brainteaser . give it a whirl .,"you’re in luck , this is an easy one . in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver , what food is no longer consumed ?"
9073,what’s with the fish ?,it’s an experiment .
7062,okay .,"whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . just because i love you doesnt mean girls are allowed in my room ."
9481,let’s put it to a vote . all those in favour… .,"point of order . i move that any vote on team names should be unanimous . no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger , when common sense dictates it should be an army ant ."
5543,dont they lay eggs on a rock ?,now ive got room for another thing . what do you want ?
4356,"it’s a little hard to explain . he does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in , but he can’t perceive us .",don’t flatter yourself . i’m just ignoring you .
2113,shh-shh-shh !,what ?
3216,"no , we discussed it . we decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well .",indeed . nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine .
3814,"uh , this is my friend , sheldon . sheldon , this is emily .","oh , yes , you’re the dermatologist . i went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen . do you see anything on my forehead that i should be concerned about ?"
8365,what ?,"secret keeping is a complicated endeavour . one has to be concerned not only about what one says , but about facial expression , autonomic reflexes , when i try to deceive , i myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility . it’s a joke . it relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid , and tic the involuntary muscular contraction . i made it up myself ."
2278,i didn’t have clams .,i don’t watch you 24 hours a day . i don’t know what you do .
4599,you admit amys a distraction ?,"oh , very much so . listen to this . this is from two days ago . hi . hope youre having a good day . who has time for this constant sexting ?"
13,what are you doing ?,"afk . i’m playing age of conan , an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e . howard’s conan the barbarian ."
8988,"fine . if i do have a threesome , you can’t be part of it . i’m just kidding , yes you can . can you bring a friend ?",i think a birthday party is a terrible idea . i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish .
1525,"well , at least you finally got a window that opens . that’s nice .",is it ? listen .
2365,do it .,what ? did she do it yet ?
4648,"sheldon , when i said couples costume , i meant like romeo and juliet or cinderella and prince charming , not two robots from some silly movie i don’t even like .","okay , i’m gonna let that slide because i know you’re hopped up on tea bags ."
374,"well , the diner scene . where’s my diner scene ?","well , don’t ask me . until i see the prequel , i’m lost ."
8299,"the court would advise you to make it quick , as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an imodium .","very well , a quick opening statement . like a milking stool , my case rests on three legs . i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic . i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum , that which is necessary is legal . but first , i will raise a sixth amendment issue . i’m unable to confront my accuser , a non-human entity , to wit , a camera . so , to sum up , improper instruction , quod est necessarium est licitum , sixth amendment . my milk stool is complete ."
6477,"okay , i got it , i got it , she’s not your girlfriend . now listen to me . i know about loneliness . i know about trying to replace someone with other stuff . when i broke up with penny , i got back into my cello , i built a bunch of model rockets , i got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell .","you didn’t break up , she dumped you ."
525,"all right , sheldon , what part of this is supposed to make me feel better ?",the part where i tell you i’ve engineered a rematch with stuart’s team for tonight .
6895,"well , a relationship is more complicated than a french fry .","not according to the work of berscheid , snyder and omoto ."
3591,"we don’t need strength , we’re physicists . we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes . give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth , it’s just a matter… i don’t have this… i don’t have this i don’t have this .",archimedes would be so proud .
7904,i’m batman .,"oh , i hardly think so . the real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late ."
2958,"sheldon , we agreed we’d do something different tonight .",all right . let’s go to the comic book store .
529,"you’re not gonna leave me alone until i do it , are you ?","oh , i think we both know the answer to that question ."
3714,"no , i don’t want to break his heart . i love him . this is just happening too fast .",you think this is fast ? it’s just a matter of time before i see amy’s leg stubble in my shower .
4732,are you having the sex talk with me ?,"well , someone has to ."
1394,please . dateline could use it to attract predators .,"penny , this is your enterprise , so it’s ultimately your decision , but based on the quality of his work , i’d strongly recommend that we let leonard go ."
5631,screw that .,she can’t sh**t me . she’s dead .
6563,"yeah , what about kryptonian pit stains ?",superman doesn’t sweat on earth .
4703,"that’s some tough talk , i may need to cut you off .","yeah , maybe you better , i took a pretty big sip ."
1712,of course .,"now , before i start , i need you to know that im very excited about this , and anything you say that isnt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question . so , keep an open mind ."
9506,yes .,"it’s on , bitch ."
955,"well , that was rude .","well , i know , but he means well . sing ."
6675,would you say that’s about 40 milliliters ?,more or less .
3453,"honey , you can’t make people like each other .","not true . leonard made me like you . and let me tell you , that was a hard row to hoe . cheers , pal . ooh . boy , that is a treat that’s hard to b*at . get the mad hatter on the horn , i’m having a tea party ."
2071,"you told her i lied , why would you tell her i lied ?",to help you .
9492,"leonard , you said i only had to ask questions .","the objective of the competition is to give correct answers , if i know them , why shouldn’t i give them ?"
158,no .,i’d be much further along if i’d been allowed to practice .
7005,"that’s professor wilkinson’s wife , she’s like 80 years old .",but she’s female . isn’t that the game ?
352,sheldon…,talk to the hand .
6078,dont worry about that . im happy to take you to work .,"well , thank you . and leonard never lets me have french toast sticks in the car . i cant have syrupy fingers , but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl ."

2920,"oh , no , you didn’t trade the food for magic beans , did you ?","of course not . and , technically , magic beans would be food , although eating them would be quite a waste , since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk , which would provide enough roughage for a small city ."

5084,that’s because i don’t .,"just , look , see , this first question makes no sense , how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving ? there’s no possible way to answer that , a car length is not a standardized unit of measure ."

3972,"well , you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up , and now you can be one for your nephew .","ugh , all right , i’ll go . but from what i’ve seen , his attention span is as limited as his bladder control ."
5370,you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain .,"four keys ! who does he think he is , a warden ?"
4133,"yeah , but if he’s a sore loser , maybe you’re better off without him .",you’re right . i guess i just have to make lemonade out of the two of you . he played ! he played ! coop and rolling thunder are together again . he was okay with that nickname .

1933,pun intended ?,i’m sorry . what pun ?
4675,he tried to score with penny .,"so have these two , and theyre having dinner with us ."
892,how come youre up so late ?,"i posted the last episode of fun with flags hours ago , and not a single person cared enough to comment . all that effort for nothing ."
7287,make this interesting ? you bet money on me ?,"no , no . we designed an experiment involving you . see ? now , isnt that interesting ?"

2466,i don’t think penny would cheat on leonard .,"oh , really ? she and i once had a staring contest . she clapped really loud and made me blink . it’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity ."
7657,but it’s thursday . thursday’s pizza night .,"not for me . thursday is now cruciferous vegetable night . tonight’s selection , brussels sprouts ."
1913,by all means .,howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to bernadette .

3845,"yeah , it does , and here we are .","you know , i have to say , penny , i don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging leonard to do this ."
6402,"sheldon , i know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench , but , you really have a mortal enemy ?","in fact , i have 61 of them . would you like to see the list ?"
936,sorry . syrup .,"all right , mom . when you’re at the ripley’s believe it or not museum , if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son , believe it , because it’s true ."

5429,well i am unhappy .,i thought where you come from they donâ€™t have emotions .
7827,"your friendship means a lot to me as well , what else ?","well , our earthquake supplies , we have a two day , two man kit ."

4388,"okay , here’s my question , why did you sit down ?","to help . look , if you fail at this relationship , and history suggests you will , then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed ."

7069,"sheldon , someday , if you get a car , i’m sure they’ll give you another parking space .","i don’t want another parking space . i want my parking space . it’s perfect . it’s a corner spot , cutting the risk of door-dings in half . it’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance . the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel . which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks ."
4361,"hey , sheldon .",what is shaking ?
1771,wait . you have to help me get into bed . sheldon has to get me into bed . bet you never thought i’d say that .,yes . the charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds .

3810,i don’t know . the bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in schindler’s list is tough to b*at .,"ah , very good . because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust ."
4346,leonard is wrong .,"considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked , don’t you think that , just this once , you could return the favour ?"
545,the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball !,"thank you , jesus ! as my mother would say ."
3241,"oh no , no , you see , in the winter , that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm , yet not so close that he sweats . in the summer , it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there . it faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct , so he can still talk to everybody , yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted .",perhaps there’s hope for you after all .

6640,i’m afraid not . is there anything else ?,"is there anything else ? where would you like to start ? he refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books i lend him . he crashed the mars rover while attempting to impress a woman . he recommended that i go see the third matrix movie because it was , and i quote , just as good as the first one . if that’s not irresponsible , i don’t know what is ."
7694,"no , it’s not .",section 74 . c . the various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot .
8230,"well , we did it .","yes , we did , my friend ."
7126,"when there was a lice epidemic at my school , everybody got it except me . i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair , but i just got attacked by bees .","i can just picture them all right now at feynmans house , probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time , not discussing schrodinger . see ? theyre missing out on hilarious jokes like that ."
4278,"well , have you considered telling her how you feel ?","leonard , i’m a physicist , not a hippie ."
2983,i don’t need any insights . i just want to know why penny’s more interested in stuart than me . we’re practically the same guy .,"oh , i disagree . stuart is taller , artistic , self-employed and , most significantly , he gets 45 percent off comic books ."
130,you cannot blow up my head with your mind .,then i’ll settle for an aneurysm .
7980,so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit ?,"because he is neither tall nor immortal , and none of us could be the flash ."

3223,"it was a late-night vote . we were all exhausted , and he was threatening to filibuster . it’s not technically road trip god , it’s travel supervisor .",although road trip god does have a certain ring to it .
7693,"fine , but don’t expect my help .","you have to help , it’s in the roommate agreement ."
5392,then what can i do ?,"leonard , i am overwhelmed . everything is changing and it’s simply too much . i need to get away and think ."
614,"with all due respect , dr . cooper , are you on crack ?","fine ! smoot-cooper . wow , what a diva ."
9649,"okay , the wifi extender is on , the cameras on , theyre both on the same network; we should be getting an image .",all i see is a black screen . and my own reflection . i look sad .

8882,howard has a heart condition ! you know that !,"well , i thought he made that up . isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of jewish people ?"
4232,what’s going on ?,it would seem amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot .
7686,"oh , sheldon !","if it makes you feel any better , thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night ."
4430,i can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking .,"just for the record , my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears ."
390,"penny proposed , and i didn’t say yes .",why not ?
9606,what’s this ?,"oh , that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface ."
7124,probably not . its an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities .,"you know what ? i used to be a fan of evolution , but ive since evolved , and now i think its dumb ."
5913,i dont think thats what you want at all .,"why , of course its what i want . why would i say its what i want if its not what i want ?"

9308,yeah .,but you didn’t even hear the details .
6609,"oh , yeah , you , too .","priya , if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness , it may stem from the fact that leonard and penny used to , if i may quote howard , do the dance with no pants ."
5319,"if i was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie , which train should i get on ?",are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice ?

404,sunday’s gone .,"not sunday , i love sunday ."

9244,"all right , i don’t understand . why didn’t you just tell kripke the truth ?","because the truth made me look bad , whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good . anyway , if kripke asks , tell him my coitus with amy is frequent , intense and whimsically inventive ."

3925,"oh , okay . sounds like it’s me and you , sheldon . how about we sic some guppies on those puppies ?","as i’ve stated before on numerous occasions , the only sea creature i would even consider being eaten by is the kraken , because the last words i would hear are “release the kraken . ” that never gets old . “release the kraken ! ” oh , chills . besides , i’m having dinner with amy ."
4158,"mmm , what smells so good ?","that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer , a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds . not only is it indian cuisine , which koothrappali loathes , it contains a generous helping of peanuts , which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister . and finally , it’s main ingredient is paneer , a farmer’s cheese which would cause leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes ."
7449,"ah , it’s okay .",penny ? penny ? penny ? penny ?
8415,so it’s nothing i did ? it’s her problem ?,i drank milk that tasted funny .

6132,"ooh , emily . i heard him say that to emily . hey , i thought you were staying home .","yeah , i was , but after talking to penny , i realised something . i , first , shes trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are . and second , the reason i may not be progressing in my research is ive created too pleasant of an environment for myself ."
5320,no .,"all right , then . you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information ."
7312,satisfied ?,hardly . consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario . a young woman alone in the big city . her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her .

7419,"come on , sheldon . you know all the christmas stories , and the carols , you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there . just admit it . you’re getting a little yuletide spirit .","oh , don’t be silly . christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry . why is this so important to you ?"
3141,"okay , well , do you want to go ?","of course not . i’m a theoretical physicist , a career i chose in no small part because it’s indoors , but if i’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there , i will be the scientist to confirm string theory . people will write books about me . third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life ."

4980,now just read your mother’s line .,"shelly ! shelly , how many times have i told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch ? goodness , i’ll never understand that boy . but then again , i’m a religious nut , and my mind is closed to so many things ."

6293,"and as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends , how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into leonard’s food .","well , excuse me . that was not a betrayal , that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy ."

9163,"guys , sorry i’m late . i have amazing news .","bernadette , before you change the subject , does anyone have any final comments on leonard’s faulty digestive system ?"

5442,mmm .,"leonard , penny , i just , i want you both to know that i regret my actions toward the two of you . thatâ€™s a lie ."

6102,"sheldon , it was just a little tremor .","a little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy . oh , i dont care for this at all . oh , i need to see hes okay ."

1069,i can’t help it . my howie wowie has an owie .,that is the most sickeningly sweet thing i have ever experienced . and i am sipping kool-aid through a red vine .
2205,i don’t think i can go out with her tonight .,then don’t .
9435,"kites , ho !","excuse me . youâ€™re misusing the word ho . itâ€™s an interjection used to call attention to a destination , not an object , as in , uh , land , ho ! or , uh , westward , ho !"
7339,"that’s enough , sheldon .","all right , let’s get right to the vote . show of hands all those opposed to leonard and his reign of tyranny ."

4893,i’m gonna go talk to penny .,"i’m going to go inside , put on my coziest pajamas , curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over . penny . sorry ."
225,shall i wait ?,"yes , please . how may i help you ?"
3354,"you know , for an extra four bucks , i can have this thing here tomorrow .","well , i know it was your idea , but the reporter said hes been following my work for a while , and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is cause my name is on it ."
5895,what do you mean ?,"according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson , in order to maximize performance , one must create a state of productive anxiety . so id like to ask you all to do something for me . keep me on my toes . just throw me off my game . essentially , go out of your way to make my life miserable ."
8754,get rid of her how ?,"i don’t know , but apparently i’m in some kind of relationship , and you seem to be an expert at ending them ."
3436,and you ?,enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price . the manager recognized wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine . right next to it . i was closer to it than i am to you right now .
1693,"id say it now , but look at those cheekbones .","i miss stuarts place . all this loud music and exposed brick . what , is this a comic book store , or a rave at the third little pigs house ?"
6893,im not jealous . i just think its silly for you to compare relationships like theyre something that can be quantified .,"everything is quantifiable . that french fry ? a seven . spider-man ? a nine . the number nine ? oddly , only a four ."
1045,i’d make fun of sheldon for having girl problems if i wasn’t in shock that sheldon has girl problems .,"no , leonard , go ahead and mock . like my daddy always said , shelly , women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom ."
3446,hey . what brings you in ?,"penny , if you wouldn’t mind , i’d like to have a conversation about girls ."
8050,"oh , gas-x has a new ultra strength . i guess they really do read their mail .","hey , isn’t that professor proton ?"

6944,way to go the extra mile . your mee-maw would be proud .,my mee-maw must never know of this . now will you give professor hawking my paper ?
5699,i don’t care . i’m taking a stand . metaphorically .,"all right , that’s it . strike three ."
8352,"sheldon , may i ask you a question ?","i would prefer that you not , but i won’t go so far as to forbid it ."
956,"happy kitty , sleepy kitty…","what are you trying to pull , mom ? from the top ."
2869,"uh , which one , the classic burger , the ranch house burger , the barbecue burger or the kobe burger ?",can’t we just go to big boy ? they only have one burger . the big boy .
4433,"thank you , dr . cooper .","you’re welcome , dr . hofstadter ."
4973,where no sheldon has gone before .,"it’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century , where his genius is not only appreciated , but celebrated ."
2961,"you heard that , ladies’ night ladies ? we’re eventually coming for you !",fascinating .
2200,"sheldon , what’s the point ?","just like schrodinger’s cat , your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad . it is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is ."
98,hey sheldon !,hello penny .
9599,"no . i’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship , and i know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want .","i said leonard , you said no ."
2557,as i was saying…,"you’re telling it wrong . ira , to really understand the story here , you have to start at the very beginning . a small town in east texas , where a young genius named…"
8445,"not in a rush , busy with work . . .",things are good right now .
4199,"uh , i was hoping you wouldn’t notice . irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes , and sadly as it turned out , space heaters .","ladies , please . these four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach . but through no one’s fault , penny , the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined . and again , i’m looking at no one in particular , penny ."
5539,you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash .,perhaps the emotion youre referring to was shock at you having something cleaned .
1648,sure . what are you doing ?,i’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes .
6197,"i hate to tell you , but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd .","you’re clearly misremembering . your mother is brilliant , analytical , insightful , and i’m betting she never hit you with a bible because you wouldn’t eat your brussels sprouts ."
6295,"well , uh , i can’t believe you used sheldon’s toothbrush .",you used my toothbrush ?
4499,maybe .,"leonard , penny , excellent . i’d like to say i’m very happy that you’re back together , and if i can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere , i will . in the meantime , i’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address penny’s annoying personal habits ."
1154,"so , sit next to me .","no , i sit there ."
2255,are you sure ?,what are you suggesting ?
3170,excuse me .,is that a yes or a no on the freezer ? the woman has the attention span of a gnat .
7400,would you just look inside ?,"oh , a scroll . i like scrolls . they’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word . after stone tablets and skywriting . you have all been summoned to join a thrilling dungeons and dragons adventure . your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred . i like where this is heading . your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres . oh , that’s a saucy twist . that leader’s name , santa claus . no , no , no ."
7158,"you know , he might not reopen . he didnt get a lot of money from the insurance company .","oh , boy , if there is one thing that gets my goat , its those dad-gum insurance companies ."
3108,hey .,"okay , now that everyones here , we can begin ."
4548,"it would be pretty awesome to hang out with him . i just used awesome wrong , didn’t i ?","well , i’m e-mailing him right now ."
5423,therefore ? to not play with it would be ?,"illogical . oh , damn it spock , youâ€™re right . iâ€™ll do it ."
2049,"sheldon , are you worried about your safety .","no , i imagine if you were going to k*ll me you’d have done it a long time ago ."
9208,"what do you think , sheldon ? want an action figure that looks just like you ?",would it come with kung-fu grip ?
8815,now ?,hurry . we’re going to be late .
9547,it doesn’t . i know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster .,"look , i appreciate the effort , but i’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me ."

4061,"no problem . bye . oh , and , bye , bro ! .",penny for your thoughts .
5534,"uh , i’m gonna go lie down .","that’s a good idea , get your rest . there are a lot more rich old ladies out there , and daddy needs a new linear accelerator . and i thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you ."

8120,your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise .,cluck-cluck-cluck .
8155,cheers .,"priya , do you know why this is called a toast ?"

5759,"sheldon , hang tight . hey , do you want me to bring anything ?","oh , yes , please . a pair of pants . and my toothbrush . yeah , and my mail . and a really good comeback for chicken legs , because ""i know you are , but what am i ? "" was met with stony silence ."

2976,i have got to learn how to draw . hey !,"once again , defeated by your own prurient interests ."
8680,"alright , noted . but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister .","oh . okay . you know , i don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but , we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d g*n with that thought ."

1734,no one’s saying that . let’s go .,"well , it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks , we both might die in a fiery car crash ."
2911,yeah .,i still don’t care .
8338,could you tell us ?,"let’s see . snake eyes . sorry , bud ."
1986,don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction ?,"our apartment was broken into , our security system tried to k*ll me , and as a result , i’m leaving pasadena forever . tell me how that’s overreacting ."
6546,something his mother taught him .,"all right , elizabeth , the bathroom is yours . the seat is down , and has been sanitized for your protection ."
7098,it’s not just a parking spot . he can’t handle the fact that i’m a bigger deal than he is now .,"oh , preposterous . i have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations , i have changed the way we think about bose-einstein condensates , and i am also the one who got nutter butters in the cafeteria vending machine . maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space . now , if you’ll excuse me , i have work to do ."
2811,did anyone see how he did it ?,"don’t worry , i’ve got this . ladies and gentlemen , honoured daughters . while mr kim , by virtue of his youth and naivety , has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact , let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted , and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me . thank you ."
659,"well , hello there .",professor hawking ?
2511,"so , i understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake .",yes .

8800,"oh , honey , did your mom not have the talk with you ? you know , when your private parts started growing ?","i’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce , which is messy , unsanitary , and based on living next to you for three years , involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity ."

1930,bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you . the meme has reached full penetration .,pun intended ?
7125,being left out is a terrible feeling . no one understands that better than i do .,"hey , look at that . even in your example , youre all by yourself ."
197,"yeah , well , i’m sick , too .","not my problem . i just don’t understand how this happened to me . i’m scrupulous about my hygiene . i regularly disinfect my hands , and i avoid contact with other people on general principle ."

4218,"sheldon , my world is crumbling around me .","point of order . as you’re in distress , it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage . but i’m a guest in your home , so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage . how do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages ?"

3073,"yes . uh , welcome back .",thank you . i assume youd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory ?
7555,are you fun in any of them ?,the math would suggest that in a few i’m a clown made of candy . but i don’t dance .

775,okay .,"excuse me . is it at all possible that youre knitting a pair of pants ? oh , well , no , youre understandably terrified . but , you know , allow me to explain . 45 days ago , um , i embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory , and my favorite comic book store b*rned down , and when my room mate got engaged , my girlfriend wanted to move in with me , which was no doubt a ploy just to see my , well , excuse my language , but my bathing suit parts . uh , sir , may i use your phone ?"
9670,"okay , i think ive narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip .","very impressive . you know , when youre done with that , can you look at this ? it doesnt make smoke anymore ."

9167,"i’ll make it simple for you . i study the brain , the organ responsible for beethoven’s fifth symphony . bernadette studies yeast , the organism responsible for michelob lite . is there something wrong with your neck ?",it’s a little stiff . what a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload . not unlike balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick .
2747,"on the count of three . one , two…",wait . i’m a little concerned . blueberries are rich in antioxidants .
2047,"yes , i did .","and you did it so casually , no rapid breathing , no increase in perspiration ."
7849,i see a problem .,our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people .
2558,sheldon .,"that’s right , sheldon cooper . he was bitten by his neighbour’s dog , leading to his first scientific breakthrough , the doggie death-ray . which , sadly , he couldn’t build because santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium ."
9274,"sheldon , i don’t understand . i thought you said you were fine with it .","well , i was . but that was before howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other ."
8666,"look , you’re here , we have plenty of room .",no we don’t .
6396,"it gets better . someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist , and guess who that someone is .",mohammed lee .

1184,can we please stop saying coitus ?,technically that would be coitus interruptus .
6420,"oh , wow . i haven’t seen one of these in years . remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating ?","brent spiner , what have you done ? that was an original mint-in-package wesley crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend , wil wheaton ."

860,"oh , god .","and it was literally the moment you walked out the door . but i see the type of personal revelations you’re going for . okay , here’s one i thought i’d take to the grave ."
7270,"all right , well , if im understanding this right , and all she did was help out another scientist , im thinking you might have to let this one go .","ugh , let it go . i have heard that my whole life . every time something upsets me somebody says , let it go , you know , like its my fault , and its not okay to feel the way i feel ."
