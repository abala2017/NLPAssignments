really,the best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100 of your time and energy to it when i decided i was going to be a physicist i didnt take some other job in case it didnt work out which wasnt easy because there was a lot of pressure from ms pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year

i heard of em didnt know they were a band sheldon shes gone you can turn off the blender,has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end
we could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked,mmm not bad you know in medieval times idle chatter was punished with a device called the scolds bridle its an iron cage thats locked around the head and pierces the tongue
and what does fortythree mean,you dont need to know you dont deserve to know and you will never know
what the hell are bus pants,they are pants one wears over ones regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on but perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder youve lost touch with the struggles of the common man

and that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide,your parents made the right decision
what,evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep so that theyll be roused by a crying baby if you want to avoid waking her speak in a lower register
okay good luck,wait what am i supposed to do
sheldon i got this,you clearly dont what my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is youre a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity
oh for gods sake,but shes not my favourite of the xmen in order that would be wolverine cyclops oh wait i forgot professor x professor x wolverine cyclops iceman then storm angel the beast oh wait nightcrawler professor x nightcrawler wolverine cyclops iceman then storm angel
guys there are four of us and one of him,which means his triumph will be even larger minstrels will write songs about him

zack,all right lets start over what did you say when zack walked in
its not soup its courage,no it isnt but i suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials we could utilize quantum coupling,well i wonder if anyones tried that
hold on wil and amy had an argument,yes quite the kerfuffle
can you please just let it go,oh i can help you with that imagine youre holding an ordinary pen while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket
i mean the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the fivehundredth power in addition ooh look chocolate milk,i sense a disturbance in the force
all right you brought this on yourself sheldon get him,if a zombie bites you you turn into a zombie however if a mummy bites you all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite so like a zombie thats been eaten from the waist down you sir have no leg to stand on
prove it,knock knock
you dont honestly think that do you,leonard i assumed you knew the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy howard and bernadette raj and his girlfriend penny and chardonnay penny and you
youre still awake,for a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid youre still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump
no,i do and yet im doomed while you live on
yes i did good right,yes amy are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship
oh my god what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder,episodes of sub psychotic rage
good morning,hello

oh no,what
iâm sorry what,a date you and me dining dancing perhaps youâd like to take in a prizefight
no no of course not just have your relationship someplace else,may i point out that for eight long months i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her offkey country music caterwauling the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore
sheldon you are not in charge,thats mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner
oh uh priyas calling in a few minutes on skype and we are gonna have a dinner date,its eight oclock in the morning in mumbai how can she have dinner
okay now that youre back on the team lets get you caught up,before you begin let me say again how deeply sorry i am for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership

i have no immediate plans,if that changes let me know and finally area rugs pro or con
im mad at you how could you just go away like that without even saying goodbye and then call leonard for help instead of me,amy may i please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate
i uh i guess youre probably wondering whats got me down,actually i was wondering if i could add a third new chess piece how do you think people would feel about prince joey the kings feebleminded but wellmeaning cousin

und ich bin eine pretzel,und dis is sheldon cooper presents fun
yeah he came into the restaurant sorry the napkins dirty he wiped his mouth with it,i possess the dna of leonard nimoy

sheldon its me,but meemaw just made cookies
what do you want,remember how leonard told you we couldnt come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium

youre right im fine im wearing this,really a blazer all right yes hello this is dr sheldon cooper yeah im at 2311 north robles avenue yeah id like to report a dangerous wild animal a blue jay im sorry this is animal control i dont understand the laughter no the bird is not in my home if he was in my home i obviously would have called 911 sir i have no doubt that there are things that youre frightened of being stuck in a deadend public service job or your wife stepping out on you because youre stuck in a deadend public service job or spiders dont you think i tried making cat noises
why not,according to an online message board i may be having a panic attack soccermom09 had similar symptoms but to be fair the twins were a real handful that day

this plasma grenade ha look its raining you,you laugh now you just wait until you need tech support
why would she even do this,shes been conducting an experiment on apes where theyre given various puzzles to solve i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldnt be able to solve them thats when amy said want to make this interesting
why would i be interested i have penny,yeah for now but that woman has a death wish leonard she talks to strangers she pets unfamiliar dogs and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment if i were you id get a backup
i dont know i guess i like that i hate it it makes me work harder,and to clarify
yeah well i do and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern i drink a lot ill have a screwdriver please dont be chintzy with the screw,i would like a root beer float

all right this is oneonone first person to five wins the office any questions yes sheldon,five what
you want to know what i think i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you or even smarter scares the pants off you and you cant deal with it,interesting point youre suggesting that i have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority
you know a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other lifeforms would probably not end well for us,its a frisbeesized wormhole leonard you can block it with a frisbee calm down
did you tell them that youre holding your convention at a marie callenders and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie,i didnt even get to that part
sheldon sheldon im worried about you youre not eating you havent slept in days and to be honest that cap is starting to smell,i know its replaced godzilla as my principle source of anxiety
well wait dont you want to know how i figured it out,no one likes a knowitall penny

okay,hurry

no no occasion just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps,did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded
oh all right suup,oh good i used that right anyway youre aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component
really on top of everything else youre afraid of birds,its called ornithophobia and someday it will be recognized as a true disability and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building which is unfortunate because i have a fear of nets
hi,now if youll excuse me the father of the atomic bmb wants a saucer of milk
come on do i really have to,i suppose we can stay up and talk
what does that have to do with me and women,nothing it was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation
yeah what,amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother

okay,whats the protocol for leaving
what heavy machinery lets just start,well as a texas gentleman im inclined to say ladies first although im concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins perhaps we should flip a coin or if youre familiar with the rules of rock paper scissors
clothes sheldon i need clothes,okay here
okay thats enough,quick poll ps4 or xbox one raj
sheldon do you want to sleep here tonight,oh as small as leonard is i dont think the two of youd be comfortable on the couch

oh okay well heres um thirty something cents and a promise i wont call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana,oh penny i see youve ordered pizza i have chinese food
yeah,howards allergic to peanuts how can i use that against him
im sure he brought it,no but last year at magic mountain he got such a bad sunburn we had to cut him out of it
well then well avoid finkleday well meet the new department head congratulate him shake his hand and go,hows this pleased to meet you dr gablehouser how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you despite the fact that youve done no original research in 25 years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement mahalo
well you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture,well that approach has sheldon cooper written all over it
talk about what,oh i dont know uh weather uh fish you could do carpentry with why leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend yeah pick one your choice

you know i could totally rock a hat like that,thats the work of noted hollywood costume designer deborah nadoolman she also designed the iconic red and black jacket in michael jacksons thriller video which ive never viewed in its entirety as i find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible and also its really scary
youre going to need more than 11 hours,oh no
okay well i am going to take you shopping get you a nice suit might give you more confidence,thats not exactly a mutation that would get you into xaviers school for gifted youngsters but go on leonard
yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age sheldon you and i are the alpha males we shouldnt have to back down,true why dont you text him that and see if he backs down
no,yes
okay amy just told you some exciting news and you acted like it was no big deal,oh i see why youre confused no her news sounded important but what youre forgetting is it was an achievement in the field of biology thats all about yucky squishy things
im surprised you know that reference,what reference
heres a question as an alien pretending to be human are you planning to engage in any postprom mating rituals with amy,there are postprom mating rituals
really really bad,im surprised you struck out with penny apparently shes a big old five
are you trying to make small talk oh sweetie you really dont have to,no its the accepted convention how was your day
what,i was going to get my mail
that we go back to the way things were but when i do something for you you show a little appreciation,and how would i do that
no look mumbai palace,why why would we change we had a perfectly good palace tandoori palace is our palace

did you try calling her on the telephone,the telephone you know leonard in your own simple way you may be the wisest of us all voice mail curiouser and curiouser
hey,hello
sheldon you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny,what am i supposed to do eat french toast on a monday now that would be impossible
youre right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact,my point
our dreams are very small arent they,good news gentlemen i have tentatively accepted
you can stare at your board all day sheldon shes still going to be right,im not staring im mulling
sheldon thats very rude she helped you with your show the right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play,oh so many crazy rules
dont make this hard for me,its not hard its simple you can either sit with me your friend colleague and roommate or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with
me me let it be me,leonard you are my roommate my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer you are safe
you know there was a time when i was alone and had no friends im starting to miss that,he still hasnt responded whats taking him so long
sheldon im sorry i didnt tell you about the surgery but you were worried about nothing,oh youre hardly out of the woods no you still run the risk of infection a blood clot the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose the minute you sneeze web im moving out

oh balls,its a warm summer evening in ancient greece
whuhah woah you cant talk about that either dr cooper your language is entirely inappropriate and im gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now,i dont see why im the one being persecuted here dr hofstadter he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen you know and howard wolowitz he spent two years using university resources building a sixbreasted sex robot oh and at the office christmas party i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar
air freshener,and is that lipstick on your cheek and neck
hes the man of his family you have to respect his wishes,youre out too by the way
lets set up the equipment itll help take your mind off of it,miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up
yeah no no no you know what sheldon its okay you dont have to go into the bathroom,thats curious if theres no one here why are there two glasses of wine on the table
no sheldon id rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three yearold,alright then
im sorry but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night,there you go perfect
uh sorry guys that girl is freaky,come again
sheldon,fine sorry
excuse me i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis,it doesnt need proving
you know lets just come up with something new,you know a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction the the geosynchronous satellite from arthur c clarke the motorola flip phone that came from star trek and ive long suspected that the idea of an africanamerican president was stolen from the movie deep impact
professor tupperman is dead and that makes us,sad
if youre trying to make me feel better its not working,well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill
thats a biological impossibility and you didnt have to come,oh right yes i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian arabic and farsi why cant she get her own tv
because shes your sister,i dont understand yes we shared a uterus for nine months but since then weve pretty much gone our own separate ways
a are you kidding me and b seriously are you freaking kidding me,a i rarely kid and b when i do kid you will know it by my use of the word bazinga
thats um rum and coke without the rum,yes
she fixed your equation,she got lucky
well were going to go apologise to raj and invite him out to dinner,apologise for what
i have three brothers and two sisters sheldon i can do this all day,all right if youre not going to remove it ill remove it for you
im not and pennys qualities both good and bad are what make her who she is,you mean like that highpitched irritating laugh
if it helps you sleep then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman,really leonard insults after i spent two hours in your closet waiting for you to fall asleep
he cant help it he cant he really cant,oh wait here ill get some alkaseltzer we can build that rocket and we can sht it at bill nyes house as long as im not within 500 feet of it
all right mister i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology,perhaps youre right im sorry for my behaviour ive had alcohol and its caused me to be inappropriate
all right hurry up and close the door so they cant hear us would you stop pouting so you picked my name get over it,yes and do you know what the odds are id pick your name
yeah thatâs not it stuartâs kind of interested in amy,oh of course he is sheâs very interesting did you know when she was 14 she severed the webbing between her own toes
i just read online that arthur jeffries passed away,professor proton is dead
come on hes an underappreciated genius,still think its me
of course whats rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours,priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me
well im sure she didnt upset you on purpose besides arent you the one who says theres nothing more important than the advancement of science,no i said theres nothing more important than me advancing science
sheldon this date is probably my one chance with penny what happens if i blow it,well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind
thats not really necessary,no no ill finish making the tea while you narcissistically ramble on about whatevers troubling you
if i didnt have you life would be blue id be dr who without the tardis,is it me or does she not look so good
yeah were coming for you todd zarnecki and for the record legoland is more interactive,i almost feel sorry for the poor fool sitting in his splitlevel suburban ranch unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the san diego freeway at 71 miles an hour ease up there lead foot you trying to get us kll
wow okay well thanks i dont know what to say,there is nothing to say except im the bigger man im not kidding say it
mmm thank you,second um i thought your paper was inspired
theres nothing wrong with the science here,perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science
nope i wanna climb some wocks,this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop no one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons
kll me,it wouldnhelp the human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death
sweetheart you are a grown man,or maybe im part of a new species that lives for hundreds of years which means im still basically a toddler
i dont know what to tell you i mean why dont you talk to her,is that all you have shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go gee penny lifes giving me lemons what should i do
yeah fine whatever the point is youre wrong again,we havent established that im wrong once
regardless i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley im not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy,leonard
alright sheldon why is tapioca,tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly

we want you back on the project with us,well well well did you hear that howard
why,he said its why they hired me its its what my grant was designated for and that everybody has to do things they dont want to do he then gave an example of something he had to do even though he didnt want to which was look at my stupid face
hey how was dinner,good i had cornish game hen

sheldon,leonard oh im so happy to see you
well despite your quirks the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields,i dont know what you mean by quirks but um i do want to express my gratitude
i remember why its been a while sheldon i was actually talking about when i was a kid on star trek,how could you not like getting attention for playing wesley crusher you were wonderful a knowitall boy genius with an eidetic memory who couldnt relate to that
well thank you for peeing in my slippers,"its the eye of the tiger 
 its the ear of the bat 
 its the whiskers of the catfish 
 and the walrus"
i dont want to spend the whole day playing a board game,yeah well you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of middle earth now including the haradwaith territories
prevosts theory of exchanges,lamda equals one over pi r squared n
oh sheldon,yeah okay stop ruining valentines day and order my pizza
hes got a point,alright i think were going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine i propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine
what is it,a quarter
okay heres my question didnt you already do that,flattering but sadly no im also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system aka jogging
oh hang on sheldon getting another call,no leonard let me tell you something personal robots cannot get here soon enough
would that be a giant rats ass,for the record giant rats are possible
i dont like birds they scare me,me too most people dont see it what are you reading
youre being too literal my point is he would not meekly surrender to the rules and neither should you,are you suggesting i play dirty
oh sheldon you havent changed a bit have you,why would i change
one time when i was working with him he said that johnny depp was in the matrix i told him he was wrong but he kept insisting so i looked it up online and showed him well the next day he had a pizza party and everyone got invited but me and then he was all your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix,good lord what have i done
that is a tough one uh i know he brushes both of them,gentlemen i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me id like you to be my intellectual sparring partners from now on when i make an assertion i need you to challenge it
hey will you steam my uniform next,interesting do you recall this conversation leonard want to go halfsies on a steamer no sheldon we dont need a steamer looks like that rumpled chickens come home to roost
bells are ringing children singing all is merry and bright so hang your stockings and say your prayers cause santa claus is coming tonight whyd you turn it off,because in the last ten minutes santa came to town kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer i had a drunk uncle who did all those things nobody sings songs about him
oh awesome wesa gonna go into the movie now byebye,this is indiana jones not star trek there should be no value to his pseudocelebrity here and even at star trek conventions they only let him in if he helps set up
wow talk dirty to me,i know it doesnt seem like it to you but for me what we have is extremely intimate
alright i dont care what you say im going to the conference and im presenting our findings,and i forbid it
didnt a great man once say science demands nothing less than the fervent and,he did
no no no im im here im here to see you,if youre hoping to get in touch with bill nye i cant help you ive been informed that hes now bill nye the restraining order guy
come on sheldon,oh okay okay calm down its him hes trying to video chat perhaps i shouldnt have taken this into the real world
wait i have a request,yes
so long story short i nailed her,when he finished he shouted eureka
okay heres where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle,no no no youve misstated the atomic weight of the target
with marbles,well i needed something bigger than peas now didnt i
oh that sounds like fun,all right what were the symptoms
sheldon do you realize i dont live with the woman i love because of you no other reason just you,is that true
i meant more like a little brother,oh well i suppose i do think of you as a sister and sometimes a mother
we were in here first you cant be in here,according to the roommate agreement paragraph nine subsection b the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure and believe me i am experiencing a very majeure force
im glad youre enjoying yourself,and you said thered never be enough pasta for the three of us
oh theyre all up there huh hmm typical,its axiomatically atypical up until recently they did not know alicia and had no encounters with her in a previous location they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants so your characterization of their behaviour as typical is demonstrably fallacious
arent there any other options theres not a lot of room its gonna be uncomfortable,yes yes yeah im definitely going with colonoscopy
okay,as you know amy and i have been together a long time and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible
sure sure how did you get into this place,back door has a fivepin tumbler system singlecircuit alarm childs play you can start sorting protons and neutrons while i build carbon atoms
why,her research methodology is sloppy shes unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matters worse shes often mean to me
its great isnt it,it is aligns the lumbar cradles the coccyx balances the buttocks this is a chair worthy of the name
what,explain your sneeze
nan,theres nothing happy about it im being given credit that i dont deserve
we all do now how about dinner,oh i would assume wed enjoy insects or smaller lizards we could also pull each others tails off and grill them theyll just grow back oh my lifesize cardboard mr spock is here i know he wouldnt care for an outburst of human emotion but oh goodie oh goodie oh goodie commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded
just going to skip over that insult,what insult
ah interesting were being accused of making you do things you dont like and here you are doing the same thing to poor amy,you should point out the hypocrisy of that
its one thing to make yourself miserable but youre making everyone around you miserable too now im telling you for the last time take the cap off,oh really what if i dont and before you answer that can i have my dessert
what pressure all i said was you look handsome can you please open the door,its not just that leonard and penny also made comments about it and im not blind even i looked twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants
oh i never saw that,really
youre right lets talk about your grandmother,no i call no meemaws
this is fun huh we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch have a hot dog watch the game,whoa nobody said anything about watching the game
i suppose thats fair what do you suggest,in a perfect world id lock you in a stockade in the public square that probably requires a permit
sheldon come back youre losing me,leslie winkle penny she belittles my research
yes,i see what youre doing youre attempting to build on the work of ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood but it wont work
youre kidding,no sir no i took my dads desk chair attached a speak spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat granted most people thought i was r2d2 but still i got a lot of candy
well i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure,pchew
so what kind of things are they will you stop that,i cant help it i feel like a teen heartthrob
additional data you dog,im not sure how listening to other ninefingered banjo players makes me dog but all right
are you sure,of course im sure look at the betafunction of quantum chronodynamics the signs been changed
oh hey you guys didnt break up,no sorry to disappoint you but amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me
sure i did the one with the frogs,the one with the frogs
correct my turn,in a world where a piano is a wapon not a musical instrument on what does scott joplin play the maple leaf rag
im just saying you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,you can catch even more flies with manure whats your point
uh hello,hello
you know if youre not gonna learn how to do this they make some pretty good clipons,bruce wayne doesnt wear a clipon
it was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem,story problem you oh amy what a dewyeyed mooncalf you are raiders of the lost ark is the love child of steven spielberg and george lucas two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation ive watched it 36 times except for the snake scene and the facemelting scene which i can only watch when its still light out but i defy you to find a story problem heres my jaw drop it
not double blind studies,how could there be a double blind study who would be the control group
no way dude,this is incredible im so happy im not even going to question their judgment in picking you im just going to run home and start packing
you ready,yes
uhhuh yeah do i stay in the jungle or go towards the beach,it doesnt matter right now youre looking for treasure
there might be a reason for that,sweaty unhygienic looks dumb take your pick
oh sheldon stay,but
well come on we wont tell anyone,sorry badgering me wont work what you should have said is its pointless to keep this a secret because penny will tell us
ill tell you what how about we go rockpaperscissors,ooh i dont think so no anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rockpaperscissors players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 of the time due to the limited number of outcomes i suggest rockpaperscissors lizardspock
sheldon i know youre in the zone but do you want some tea all right i cant believe im gonna say this but you havent spoken in hours and im starting to get worried please say something,leonard prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius
all right dont get upset but an earlier appointment opened up for leonard and hes getting the surgery right now,i see take me to leonard
not done by the time i finally got to work theyd given my shift away yeah thats right ive lost an entire days pay thanks to this this,time machine
i cant feel my fingers hurry up,its the same amount of work no matter how fast you go basic physics
leonard bear left and continue on interstate 210,ooh sounds like that fellow knows what hes talking about id put on my listening ears if i were you
sorry do you think im overdressed,it depends on the activity for a prostate exam yes if youre playing vegas id add sequins
youre right im the problem im the one that needs help,well thats not much of an apology but ill take it
so what do you guys do for fun around here,well today we tried masturbating for money
and,i reject it
you do youre not messing with me,not at all in fact i have got something for just such an occasion i was starting to think i might never get a chance to give it to you good job
uhhuh anyway im not sure shes the best fit for our little how should we call it rebel alliance,oh i never identified with the rebel alliance despite their tendency to build death stars ive always been more of an empire man
so does that mean we can go with the girls again,hulk agree to second date with puny humans
really i mean are you sure,i see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine
i go outside and i talk to people alright here what actor holds the record for being named people magazines sexiest man alive,william shatner
well i dont think thats gonna help at all,oh no it will see by keeping my mind engaged ill become more focused
uh its date night arent you uh forgetting something,oh of course did i mention the ps4 controllers light up
sheldon here is your money thank you very much it helped a lot,sarcasm
oh that sounds like a good thing,well it would be except that i left string theory because i decided it was a dead end yeah and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong my rival no less im sorry you had to see that
im sweating already,yeah as the person beneath you allow me to say i know
good night you,guten tag das youtube ich bin ein bavarian
i dont think i want to go out with you anymore,will you please stop joking around im trying to figure this out
oh hey sheldon can i help you find something today,no no i was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person
what,you have so few good ideas leonard and youre just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider
you embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here image number five kitten in a teacup,aw embarrassed you
in wieu of fwowers the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of febweze,if were going to change the topic from jellyfish id be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle
which was,a powerful laxative
like a dogboy,exactly

no,are you sure you look a bit puffy
hey so you guys ready to order,since we come in every tuesday night at six oclock and order the same exact thing and its now six oh eight i believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out and uh how are they hanging
what are you saying that im threatened by alicia that im like the old queen of the hive and its just time for me to go,im just talking about bees theyre on the discovery channel what are you talking about
no come on lets talk about our lives tell me something about you i dont know,i own nine pairs of pants
so go to the bathroom,i cant
i just want to ask you a few questions about howard wolowitz,oh all right i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex
sheldon its fine,if it were fine the light wouldnt be on thats why the manufacturer installed that light to let you know its not fine
what,i forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous

lets go baby were losing daylight,um as you know several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when i called you an idiot and i just wanted to say that i was wrong to point it out
yeah what if i buy my own desk,thats ridiculous
whats that,as a symbolic gesture to all the bullies whove tormented us for years we open our home to jimmy and once hes asleep we kll him i said it would be nice i didnt say we should do it
golden dragon,no no this isnt right our food always comes in szechuan palace containers
yeah,thats my parking spot
ii dont think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in,yodas swamp was in the middle of nowhere tatooine was in the middle of nowhere hoth was in the middle of nowhere thats code leonard he wants us to drop in
guys,do you know that the word wiener comes from the german name of the austrian capital vienna or wien
fine its true i deserve romance and i didnt know how else to make it happen,well if you want romance then lets have romance oh look theres wine mmm grape juice that burns uh now lets gaze into each others eyes hmm you blinked i win
and youre stuck,why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus
it is not the only logical explanation for example you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by say a coconut,was i hit on the head by a coconut
he tried to score with penny,so have these two and theyre having dinner with us
oh i never saw that,really
you want me to work with you,for me youre going to have to listen more carefully when youre on the job

okay fine its soup and a small sandwich is that what you want,of course not ill have my usual
excuse me sorry excuse me,cut did you not see we are rolling
okay you know what you are unbelievable you buy all these superhero tshirts but when its time for you to step up and do the right thing you just hide in the laundry room,fine ill go just for the record my aunt ruth died in a hospital she went in to visit my uncle roger caught something and bit the dust a week later the two of them now share a coffee can on my mothers mantel

yeah well my question is and im pretty sure i know the answer is this your first date,that depends does squaredancing with my sister at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown count as a date
sheldon,sorry i just dont want to be yet another flipflop fatality
while you confront your mother about her sex life id rather go back to that bar in assless chaps,mother mother mother
does anyone have any words theyd like to say about our man of the evening,yeah i do as is the tradition i have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at howards expense prepare to have your ribs tickled howard i always thought youd be the last one of us to ever get married because you are so short and unappealing am i right lets see here oh seriously though howard youre actually one of the most intelligent people i know and thats a zinger because youre not ive always thought that youd make someone a fine husband someday assuming youd be able to get the parts and develop the engineering kll to assemble them which i dont see as likely hacha okay let me see here okay kidding aside howard you are a good friend and i wish you nothing but happiness bazinga i dont
we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip,and a second nontantalizing piece to use as a control
i then suggested a pub,yeah which i was initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding
i thought we agreed this was all koothrappalis fault,youre right nice going
who told you to keep going around,there was a large plant in the lobby it kept looking like the outside
yes,good
haha there goes your head again,okay this isnt at all good sportsmanship to sht somebody whos just respawned you need to give them a chance to now come on
yes,i dont care
well they dont hard as it may be for you to believe most people dont sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content,excuse me but i think weve both found that helpful at times
terrific um this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group and i need you not to embarrass me tonight,well what exactly do you mean by embarrass you
well i like it,yeah of course you do youre a girl you like all kinds of hippydippy things
hey whatre you working on,remember when i said if you went through with your surgery there was a onein700 000 chance of dying
little bit,hmm oh who cares
oh oh well good for him yeah but why are you sitting here why dont you just go to a movie or something,alone
sheldon,ive been seeing penny behind your back
all right now one benefit of quantum coupling,wait a question who decides if someones gone off topic
thank you,no thank you delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nations commerce its because of people like you people like me can limit our human contact id shake your hand but well you know
im sorry you sent more than one letter about that,it bothers me
gee why cant sheldon make friends,alright kripke that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and i would like to propose that we do that together tomorrow yes ill pay alright goodbye alright time to learn rock climbing
okay i get it i mean not all the jibberjabber in the middle but i know what its like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it,you mean your acting career
were not,what about the roommate agreement it specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the furnishing committee which only sits on alternate years yeah and by the way it sits over there
good for you,course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat so what does she know and send
how,hmm itd have to be something heinous something that makes her as miserable as shes making me oh ive got it this is good
on what,do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics
okay im sorry i dont understand,leonard explain it to her
get out,well i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine im not sure im capable of performing diagnostics
fine sheldon tell us about your giant rodents,no you squandered your time with me and the moment has now passed feast on your disappointment much as the capybara feasts on its own waste
thats supermans big ice thing right,do you know im such a good mood im actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language folksy and charming today
dont dont dont,ill tell you why
good night sheldon,wait not yet we still have to go over safety procedures now the apartment has three emergency exits located here here and here in the event of a power outage luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit
aw you brought cookies for everyone,oh yes fig newtons i was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him and then after someone said newton i was going to tell them theyre wrong the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts and then id throw the cookies away
yeah,nailed it
thank you hey maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these,penny theres only one cookie with something in the middle that solves lifes problems and thats an oreo or a nutter butter if youre in a pinch
is leonard around,he went to the movies without me it was the only option im sorry i dont understand which social situation this is could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed
incredibly so,all right fine letâs just play
gentlemen as much as im sure sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic makebelieve he and i have other plans we are attending my aunt floras 93rd birthday party,just tell her i cant come
i believe thats what your roommate did to her,what
well im off to meet bernadettes friend how do i look,as if one of the plants from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way only with an absurd amount of hair gel
sheldon do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery,i do i have the drive to the hospital right here that is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs and dont expect me to carry you i do that enough in life
out,who are you
yeah have fun,oh i will nothing more fun than a paradigmshifting evening of science
ive never had it but theres no harm in trying something new,theres a lot of harm in trying something new thats why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits
thats only for when youre sick,homesick is a type of being sick
whats going on,im mad at amy
um i dont know im waiting to hear back from the insurance company,so tomorrow
well then dont go,how can you say that the scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says dont go
you know if you ask nicely theyll let you visit the engine room,i never want this day to end
yes,well thatâs enough of that sorry to interrupt you two enjoy your date hereâs a dollar for your troubles get yourself some sour patch kids
what happened,i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard
this might not be that bad uh you like telling people theyre wrong,wrong just because i enjoyed that one doesnt mean i always do
well thankfully i wont have to see it cause i wont be your girlfriend anymore amy farrah fowler why yes i would like to take a survey,wait you were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table
i hear you broke up with amy,a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend she was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend
well now i miss him even more,well if its any consolation im sure leonards tormented every moment hes away from your warm embrace and cherry lips
its not flattery if its the truth,oh well thank you welcome aboard
youre having people over,yes must be kll you wondering who fine ill tell you stuart from the comic bookstore barry kripke from the university pennys exboyfriend zack and tvs levar burton
brilliant,it is isnt it is it okay if i hide them in your room the smell makes me nauseated
and it only took 28 minutes,impressive but we must be cautious
okay goodnight sheldon,oh mario if only i could control everyone the way i control you hop you little plumber hop hop hop
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials we could utilize quantum coupling,well i wonder if anyones tried that
ill take my chances,fine i wonder if they make i told you so cards in braille
also mine,wait im confused why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute
then what difference does it make,what difference does it make
sheldon it was just a thought,no heres a thought youre not moving in leonards not moving out everything stays exactly the way it is and by the way i saw you make this strawberry quik with syrup youre supposed to use the powder
knock yourself out,thats the toilet
all right based on a cursory reading it doesnt look like you have much of a case sheldon,do so do so
whats going on with you,well i might ask you the same question why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me but exist between you and penny a person to whom i barely speak
you shouldve seen your face,yes theres nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled
oh yeah,look at him just standing in line like he wasnt moderately famous 30 years ago lets go say hello
hocus pocus pocahontas,and may i point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with stuart and amy not me i think you need to ask yourselves whoâs really being ridiculous here
oh watch out sheldon this little boy casper is a gggghost,droll
excuse me what the hell is wrong with you,im helping you with stephanie
oh my god howard what did you do,it was a harmless halloween prank look
well thats always been a secret not even amy knows,well i dont enjoy presents and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas directors cut
like behavior modification,yeah exactly did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play pingpong
sheldon i am really really sorry but its only for a week cant you be a little bit flexible yeah sorry i didnt really think that through,you claim its going to be a week but i have no faith in your dry cleaner
we are not blackmailing peter j all right wheres the ring,you mean my ring
why are you here,ill tell you im from texas need i say more
hey sheldon are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree,no because we dont celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia

got it,pacific daylight time
im going to the movies with penny i dont want her to think that i think its a date,do you think its a date
yes it is,yeah uh look it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow even you with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders you couldnt do it
i know what it means and yes you love correcting people and putting them down,au contraire when i correct people i am raising them up you should know i do it for you more than anyone
okay youre not helping,disagree
eddie crispo anyway he said this isnt a replica its the real deal,if youre suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by sauron in mount doom i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement
it came from tiffanys,you mean the box right
well come on wheres your scientific curiosity,well most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of its wondering why im having this conversation with you
hes having problems with stephanie,shes sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet if i have any hope of keeping them together i need data specifically i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks
rockpaperscissors lizardspock,okay one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock
ooh what are you gonna get,none of your business but when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later you are most welcome to sniff it
again,it was tornado season and it was an aluminium house anyway the housekeeper in the faculty residence didnt speak any english when i finally managed to convince her i was sick she said mag das du ein anspeilung
if this doesnt get him into your bedroom nothing will,are you still mad at me
why,i cant tell you why i cant tell you so i guess theres two things i cant tell you
okay fine well just play one on one until he gets back,one on one we dont play one on one we play teams not one on one one on one
wait i dont understand they didnt find the element,oh no they found the element no no stop it i dont need to take this admiration from the likes of you people how do i make them stop loving me
what does that mean,based on what happened next i assume it means would you like an enema
is this part of the tour,nope goodbye
yeah well not necessary we broke up again,do you even think about other people leonard do you
according to what i see here thursday nights are franconis pizza night,yes and when franconis went out of business we switched to grazianos
i did you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away that leaves two frogs,thats pretty funny that does sound like me but that doesnt mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along
you want to talk about it,no i think ill just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away
yeah,your shoes are delightful where did you get them
yeah you got me im a leibniz man,well perhaps when your mother gets here shell talk some sense into you
a few months,and of those few months how long have you been a demented sex pervert
sheldon you do this all the time you fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion,name one time ive ever done that
we believe cows are gods,not technically in hinduism cattle are thought to be like god
i i figured that out,potato clock do potato clock
how could you get lost your phone has gps,satellites are down solar flares
he did very nicely,see shes not offended and now you finally have an answer
well you know i do understand what youre going through,really did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing stolen from you
so funny but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity i have to tell you i found it physically exhilarating,my hypotheses tend to have that effect
im trying dont yell at me,for goodness sake hes wearing a hat glasses and a red striped shirt
hey what if i took your class,why would you do that
here we go,in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration in the summer its directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion i could go on but i think ive made my point
yep your turn,oh amy and you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies tictactoe can only end in win lose or draw none of which will deny me closure especially since im about to win bbut we didnt finish
go to your room,but i occupy the moral high ground
crazy man call the police,no dont call the library show me your mucus oxen are in my bed many many oxen oy vey
you know some people might say that its great that were trying to make things work long distance theyd say things like love is stronger than the miles between you,when i rise to power those people will be sterilized
you walk away,walking away
lets get you to the hospital,so this is how it ends with cruel irony just as i make the commitment to preserving my body i am betrayed by my appendix a vestigial organ do you know the original purpose of the appendix leonard
or was there,what
anyway thanks again cooper suck eggs,since when do you help out barry kripke
uh oh sorry,not to worry i hid it bazinga youre in my spot
how you feeling,good little claustrophobic
then well go to a hotel,a hotel did you see the shining
infinite sheldon,yes infinite sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because i made it at work
oh uh from the context we think it means kll me now,well i suppose everyones entitled to their own opinion i think ill turn in i didnt want to teach those poopy heads anyway
so youre youre saying we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop,no
sheldon you okay,its been three days why hasnt stephen hawking played a word
and he really does have one you jerks on the comment board,so as they say all good things must come to an end
yeah we can always divide soup,what about the wontons
how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality,if we could figure out the scientific basis for martys hover board that would have universal application
hi sheldon,hes in my spot leonard make him stop being naked in my spot
ha told you okay im just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go,fun time hah sorry sometimes the clippers tickle me
oh i love milk duds okay were cool,junior mints
is it my turn to talk about the compromises i make,i wasnt done but go ahead he said compromising
excuse me were ready,no were not lets say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis i now lay the following conundrum at your feet which size
morning sheldon,morning i trust you had a pleasant night
i already found a guy online whos willing to sell,how do you know this isnt a sting operation set up by the comiccon police
that,okay i think weve found the problem here its not the table at all its you
au contraire im 26 years old im originally from denton texas but i was a navy brat so i was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world as a result ive often felt like an outsider never really fitting in which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem,excuse me we just went over this as the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention
well,no
ill agree to that only if youll stipulate that 80 of our difficulties were caused by you,ill go as high as 40
what were you doing with priya,i believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible
all right five one two three four five oh wow look at that my department of defence research grant is renewed,oh great roll now you can demolish your sovietstyle cyclotron and build the large hadron collider
please go away,said pharoah to moses
the bird,yeah its completely out of tune with the wind chimes
sheldon wait will you,just to be clear here youre asking for my assistance
so you think shell be single soon,oh if you want to get in on the pool youre too late all the squares have been purchased
problem,this is thai food
yeah i know its on sheldon oh no no no no no i cannot afford this right now,maybe its just something minor ooh good news the light just went out
let me guess you have a problem with this,where do i begin
yeah thats a real pickle bye,dont worry as your tertiary friend i am prepared to step in and comfort you
no ones getting tortured,fine well abide by the geneva convention but ask yourself this in the course of our lives how much lunch money has been taken from us how many kites how many scoobydoo trapper keepers
oh great my rhinestones thank you,excuse me
thank you,simultaneously a festival of cloying clichés you sicken me
oh people get things they dont deserve all the time look at me with you,no leonard this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life every science classroom every periodic table every textbook this mistake will be staring back at me like that time you let koothrappali wax your eyebrows ive got to find a way to stop this thing
then i guess congratulations are in order,no congratulations will have been in order you know im not going to enjoy this party
okay heres an idea what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel,that could work
sheldon i think this will work lets just try it my way,oh im im sorry i assumed that you wanted candid truthtelling from your employees but i realize now you want the mindless nattering of complacent yesmen
you guys enjoy your evening im gonna go before i ruin anybody elses weekend,ah thats my girl
hoo,zack
but its one oclock you were going to show me your laboratory at one oclock,her reasoning is unassailable it is one oclock
im sorry im not seeing the help,she was going to see through your lie eventually so i told her that you were lying to protect me
do not make a sound,whispering do not make a sound is a sound
what are you doing its time to go,im not going to work today and would you like to know why
funny were always giving each other a hard time up here its kind of like being in a frat you know joking kidding around hurting feelings,okay my turn let me talk to him
guys in 30 seconds we went from lets change the world to lets watch tv,im sorry is that a no
and there was noone there to take care of you,no no my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again
i guess,ointment
that sounds lovely why are you rubbing your hands together,um im putting on lotion are you in or not
yes,swish
yeah,why would they say at least is it ten toggles is it a hundred toggles you know is it a thousand toggles ten thousand toggles a hundred thousand toggles
sheldon you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny,what am i supposed to do eat french toast on a monday now that would be impossible
im not leaving your world im just talking about living across the hall,i understand either way i want you to know that im aware of how difficult i can be so i just want to say thank you for putting up with me
and consider this without you to make the case for the physics department the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh,are you trying to scare me cause youre succeeding
i dont know you did it to me,oh im going with it marty and doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015 that means 2015 biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 biff therefore the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 biff never gets the almanac and not just never gets never have never hasnt never had have hasnt
hey whatre you working on,remember when i said if you went through with your surgery there was a onein700 000 chance of dying
wait for moi,youre leaving
thats the del taco,why is leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door
im sorry i meant questions about the food,oh of course um is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original linkandpin coupler or the miller hook and platform
so what are you supposed to be,me ill give you a hint neeeeooooowwwww
what could she possibly be talking about for so long,obviously waitressing at the cheesecake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning bazinga you know using positive reinforcement techniques i could train that behaviour out of her in a week
so did i,do you think theyre gonna call the police
that doesnt make it true,its called nonfiction for a reason leonard
i thought i smelled popcorn,pattern is the same as fermions travels on the pathways hexagonal its always hexagonal
hi sheldon everything okay,no its not ive seen things lady things
hey sheldon,yes
shh,whose house is this
what did you write,im done hiding from bullies im taking this into the real world
doing laundry,of course im doing laundry saturday night is laundry night and im in a laundry room so i believe your inference is justified
oh you could turn his act into extract and it would be for double points,amy why would you give me a word now if i play extract it would be cheating
hey why am i in charge of phone support seems a bit rcist,a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression were a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres
okay suit yourself well probably be trashing priya a little,gn
oh is it amy,its dark matter when i entered the field of string theory i was a prodigy i rose to a position of respect and i assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory now here i am in my 30s im back at square one and frankly its frightening
and,doesnt matter does it
and i had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dads estate,the papers could have been mailed mom just sent you here to spy on me didnt she
okay i found the box now what,youre holding a japanese puzzle box which takes ten precise moves to open first locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left then on the opposite end of the box slide the entire panel down two millimetres youll hear a slight click
wow that flag is a lifesaver,no this is stop looking at my legs
okay now we all run out sheldon and i will cut to the left behind these trees raj howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks then well all have a great view as penny runs out and kll everyone else in sight,right just one thing before we start
what about leslie winkle,oh no
ive been thinking about them too sheldon being your girlfriend is so challenging emotionally physically ive been incredibly patient for years,strongly disagree go on
yes,uh extra peanut sauce
oh please i just offered a little encouragement,it was a lot more than that you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions and you pumiced my hammer toe how can i ever repay you
do you think i would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match,no i suppose not
its nice to meet you too sheldon i honestly didnt believe amy when she told me she had a boyfriend,i assure you i am quite real and im having regular intercourse with your daughter
i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes,these are my own bowling shoes
is that really true,of course thats how you know its a good joke it not only entertains it informs
oh my god theyre just making you use your vacation days,but i dont want a vacation
youre just coitusing with me arent you,bazinga
i drink,to drinking nope oh if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt
hi sheldon,here look look i found my missing neutrino
excellent,i rest my case amy dont you agree we should leave now and get in line
no no no no no you just need you just need you just need to map it out come on ill help you so uh you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times,yes
is that the american idiom for giant bigass desk,its actually british
come on priya just admit i embarrass you,youre preaching to the choir sister
no its okay what,when i lost my own father i didnt have any friends to help me through it you do
tuesday okay,dont rush it we may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level
okay now what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive,i havent fastened my seat belt yet
i guess youre right see you later,wait leonard wait what am i going to do for dinner
oh and uh check this out i took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us,hello this is sheldon
it was nice you know a lot of people showed up told some great stories about him did you know that arthurs son is a high school sci hey the guys are about to start jedi you want to go watch,i do after i make them go back and watch one through five first
what does that mean,a disappointing drink for a disappointing day
its a lease,im confused was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included
well miss you sheldon,yeah well who wants to spend the whole weekend running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters thats for babies
come on smile this is gonna be my christmas card,you know this is all your fault
bored okay these are steve maddens these are nine west these are target oh but dont they look like chanel these are michael kors these are roxy these are sachels oh these are betsy johnson theyre so cute,nobody knows the trouble ive seen nobody knows my sorrow
aaargh what the hell,emergency preparedness drill
what,we have to stop at pottery barn
there wont be any room until they get rid of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit,oh good one
i know this isnt my area and i could never do the math like you can but could this be something,well you could have set newtons gravitational constant to one and ugh the whole thing reeks of blueberry you know i cant stand these scented markers
im just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there,i cant believe my own mother is abandoning me
speaking of new careers how are things going with dark matter sheldon,oh yeah id have to say its the most exiting time in the history of the field
thats it youre not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment,no youre my friend and im sorry
sure maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death,sarcasm
you laughed,did you laugh
you lie down hell be here in a minute,okay hey i thought you were trying to trick me
whats there to learn you get naked do nasty things to each other then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami easy peasy,perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction
you know what lets just get a pizza,good idea well go to corleones
please know that we are truly,grateful
yes i remember,i resent you saying we dont have company
okay good night,nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you professor proton nice to meet you prof ow leonard
the guys a genius maybe you werent challenging enough for him,not challenging i was humiliating the man i was thinking of writing a book called a brief history of the time i made stephen hawking cry like a little girl
my point is priyas gone and it would be much better if noone else found out about this,you mean you want me to keep a secret
oh okay yeah hang on a sec,fyi i was defrosting a steak in there
sheldon,zip it pip it can i have your phone number
he probably got a new one finish your breakfast look theres an entire section of my dashboard that doesnt have any syrup on it,youre acting odd why
no no maybe a little,may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy
because leonard just pissed me off am i being an idiot or not,no i dont think you are
all right,way to go on the details
were really more,no
sheldon,penny
well you have three strikes one coming in two sitting down and three i dont like your attitude,you cant do that not only is it a violation of california state law it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy
gentlemen theres a task im trying to accomplish here and im having trouble doing it,oh my president siebert i dont mean to be an alarmist but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia if youre interested i can send you a link to a youtube video thatll show you how to perform your own rectal exam yeah uh helpful hint trim your nails first
lets look at this logically i have a stomach i get hungry i have genitals i have the potential for sexual arousal,a cross we all must bear you know in difficult moments like this i often turn to a force greater than myself
yeah ill do that,well i think were off to a terrific start
sheldon you are not sick this is but you are not,we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment and having never been to nebraska im fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies
thats very thoughtful but i think ill finish my coffee first,ah so the yogurt didnt work ill fire off a critical email to the manufacturer
im sorry too its all my fault,if you werent my friend thered be a hole in my life
ah youre kiwing me cooper,can we get back to work
oh ive got it how about if we replace panels a b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium,right then the entire things one big heat sink
well thats not gonna happen,i assumed that would be your attitude hence my true purpose in coming here
boy this is great i havent had a vacation in ages,in order to take a vacation one first has to work
because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine,you cant if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it this is a classic rookie time travel mistake
i myself grew up in nebraska small town outside of omaha you know nice place mostly family farms a few meth labs,im sorry how is this better than uncomfortable silence
were gonna have anything can happen thursday youre gonna tell me all about your science stuff and im gonna complain about my movie and were gonna support each other because thats what friends do,okay cause if i had to pick now id probably go with dark matter because
how am i betraying you,elizabeths my friend and youre playing with her
sheldon you are right im really sorry i shouldve known better,your apology is accepted
alright look a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesnt want to be disturbed because theyre you know getting busy,so youre saying leonard has a girl in there
theres your answer free food,all right ive taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our groundbreaking new app
no you werent because it was a week ago and nobody came so if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed koothrappali in the back with the wapon of indifference it was all of you,i dont think thatqualifies as a mystery we all knew what we were doing
i think its the only way to look at it,are you going to help me or not
whatever you do just dont make any rash decisions,i dont know i am really aggravated
yes,you know i cant keep a secret
you know whats wonderful about the praying mantis they devour their mate,your point being
right right youre saying you talked to penny,yes
okay let me try it this way youre annoying and noone wants to play with you any more,i see well at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears
on earth we say thank you,so leonard how goes the mimesis
yes,fine
yes,brown rice not white
certainly good night,good night leonard leonard leonard
sure,we cant have thai food we had indian for lunch
okay whats up,id like to discuss this party that amy and bernadette are throwing since you and i are both reluctant to go i think ive come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it
you still told her i lied,for a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drugaddled first cousin which im assuming is embarrassing yes
yes obviously,all right well given that missing you is predicated on you leaving logic dictates you must leave
okay well what do you communicate about,well my work in physics her work in neurobiology and most recently the possibility of our having a child together
fine sheldon you have my undivided attention,okay now the ps4 is more angular and sleeklooking
wait a minute you hate dogs,a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls no one can hate that
i know when is she going home,never thats the problem i need your help
that thats brilliant,its what i do but wait theres more i also invented two new chess pieces the serpent and the old woman
i know this isnt my area and i could never do the math like you can but could this be something,well you could have set newtons gravitational constant to one and ugh the whole thing reeks of blueberry you know i cant stand these scented markers
its just such a fascinating story your calculations are way off but they find the element anyway its like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure,can we talk about something else do you know that i yodel
look i i know this is this is change and that sounds scary,where are you going to go
all right now one benefit of quantum coupling,wait a question who decides if someones gone off topic
get out,well now that
are you done,no despite what the name suggests the civet cat is not a true cat now im done
sheldon you know i cant eat butter im lactose intolerant,way ahead of you thats an i cant believe its not butter stick
anyway um we brought home indian food and um i know that moving can be stressful and i find that when im undergoing stress that good food and company can have a comforting effect also curry is a natural laxative and i dont have to that uh a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about,leonard im not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements
no i mean i i i got the money first,smart get paid up front yeah i think you have a real knack for gigolo work leonard
sheldon cooper caltech university employee information,at the bottom
i would guess a wavefunction and then vary its parameters until i found the lowest energy solution,hmm do you know how to integrate x squared times e to the minus x without looking it up
but sheldon we dont have a chance the only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote,what you fail to realize is kripke suffers from a fatal flaw overconfidence from his robots massive size and its overwhelming power
hey sheldon youre always full of fun little facts where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from,dont know
hold on to that thought,come in
ill get you a blanket and a pillow,okay well since im obviously being ignored here lets go over the morning schedule i use the bathroom from 7 to 7
whyd you get that you hate lamb,i was asking for directions apparently there was a communication problem
ugh were the last ones here hurry up,it is a marathon not a sprint
i think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage preadolescent jews,you know we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command
no look guys keep your money i i think uh i i think im done,what well whats wrong is she upsetting you because i can make her go away
that is so sad,no whats sad is that you dont know adam west was tvs batman
fine dr cooper im sorry for your loss but the pasadena police department doesnt have jurisdiction in pandora,thats from avatar world of warcraft takes place in azeroth goodness gracious how are you allowed to carry a gn can you at least refer me to a rogue excop
thanks oh sheldon since amys out of town would you like to join us,i want you to be happy too but not enough to do anything about it
here drink this itll relax you,alcohol i dont drink alcohol
it sounds like either way i finally get some rest,i have to be honest with you leonard im truly worried
its like the happiness wont ever leave the apartment,leonard please you know amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isnt ready for
and you think thats going to help,yes
here i made you some strawberry quik,i have real problems here amy i cant be mollified with a beverage designed for children mmm yummy
okay i got to i i i i got to ask what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isnt,for starters we enjoy spending time together
well hello there,professor hawking
come on lets talk about something other than the surgery,thats a good idea penny did you and leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements
do you want to stop i know you have trouble with eye contact,well you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a formula one race car so im just concentrating on that plus its easier around people that im comfortable with
if he were any bigger hed have moons orbiting him,oh snap so i guess well be leaving now
oh good for you so all you have to do here is say youre sorry to leonard but say it sarcastically,of course he will hear it as an attempt to mend fences as opposed to the withering condemnation you and i will know it to be
thank you i thought we might start by talking about the user interface,oh dear lord were doomed
oh i dont think you can,well why not
i cannot believe theyre letting her just use them like that i mean anything she wants they go panting after her like trained dogs you know that just last week she had howard drive all the way to her uncles house in orange county to pick up her tv,you once had leonard and me get your television from your exboyfriend
what why didnt you say that first,why didnt you get extra peanut sauce we can both play this game
how could you not notice,i was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body
ive got a better idea,are you going to be sarcastic
excuse me sheldon how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point,im sorry if you didnt cheer at my entrance its too late to buy into the premise anyway i got some extra money from the head of the department and raj can come work for me
no no its about my acting career,oh sorry thats not on the list
and you think thats going to help,yes
how about i go first,but i dont want to know how many underpants you own although based on the floor of your bedroom id say its a thousand
giving mrs davis the box set of roots was,bad however
sheldon lets go,to a hospital full of sick people oh i dont think so
im excited to work with my boyfriend its gonna be romantic,way to kll the mood
hey sheldon sheldon look i am scared and in a lot of pain could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being i dont know comforting,im sorry there there everythings going to be fine sheldons here
who will come,the jewish people
mitzys dead,she was old and blind leonard what choice did we have
its better than hot its binding,if youre free tomorrow night id love to have you join us on a double date
i definitely smell raw hot dog,perhaps youre getting a brain tumour
okay sheldon what happens to our neuroreceptors when we dont get enough rem sleep,they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine
thats not what happened,i remember it distinctly because i had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of dr seusss death
fine what do you want,i have a few questions first i notice that you offer soup and a halfsandwich
do you feel better,yes but not as good as im going to when i tell you that your precious garfield has no reason to hate mondays hes a cat he doesnt have a job
the mars rover,did i say mars rover
well i hope i havent uh kept the kids waiting too long for for the show,oh no there are no kids no the the shows for me come on ill race ya arthur
what,seven years ago i found out the dvd was late and i paid for it
oh come on you mightve gone to school for a couple more years than me but guess what engineers are just as smart as physicists,you take that back
is that a real thing,well until they invent nose condoms im not finding out
tell you what next french toast day i will make you oatmeal,dear lord are you still going to be here on french toast day
sheldon do you really expect to enforce this,ive lived up to all my commitments under the agreement at least once a day i ask how you are even though i simply dont care i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing
you say thank you,every time
if this humiliating experience is really troubling you there are things we could do about it,for instance
well its all good,statistically unlikely
she told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her,yes that good news
why did you ask if i had one too,just making polite dinner conversation your turn
excuse me dr cooper im kathy obrien i just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of stringnetwork condensates and it just took my breath away,maybe when i publish it ill include an inhaler
seven of clubs that is amazing,its not amazing all magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet
anyone in,no
whats the matter,im getting dizzy
well not everybody felt that way a lot of people really hated the character and some of them hated me because of it i would do interviews and people would be mean to me,that just happened to me next time youre stuck for a tweet feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow is
thatll be 2 99,really its soaking wet
funny thing is i only have one belt anyway ill let you get started oh by the way the little marks uh that look like water spots i tend to stand too close to the urinal so what youre seeing there is splash back,you make sissy on your belt buckles meemaws forks never had that
she doesnt mean it shes just being nice,well stephanie since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball i guess ill just have to pick it up have you ever witnessed a violent crime
well im sure the new people will be just as quiet,you cant know that how can you possibly know that
well yeah,wow
i kiss you on the lips,i kiss you back on the lips as well your turn
okay what do you think,hmm well its a little hollywood but i think i can pull it off well done penny

uh yeah yeah,there problem solved
so you just want us to disagree with whatever you say,yes

all right sheldon were going to wils this is your last chance,no leonard this is your last chance one day a historian is going to come to you and say is it true you were friends with dr sheldon cooper and youre going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble i was but i chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from stand by me that no one remembers
goodbye sheldon,hold on i believe that social convention dictate you not arrive emptyhanded would you like to bring some cylon toast
sheldon thats not a real thing,well neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriends hand at the movies you know that doesnt stop you from pawing at me like youre a bear and im a trash can full of sweets
cut to the chase sheldon,okay amys decided she wants to move in with me so i need you to come back home you lovable scamp thats a lot of product

this might not be that bad uh you like telling people theyre wrong,wrong just because i enjoyed that one doesnt mean i always do
so penny doesnât want me around her friends i embarrass her what else could it be,well her actions could be out of concern for your feelings perhaps sheâs excluded you from these gatherings because sheâs scouting for a new mate and doesnât want to do it in front of you
okay nice and cosy okay ill see you later,wait will you please rub this on my chest
see this trip was good for you,indeed i was the worlds smartest caterpillar and then after pupating in our nations railway system ive burst forth as the worlds smartest butterfly

sheldon youre always saying how much smarter you are than me spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science,all your ideas address the issue at a university level by then its too late you need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences
hes upset because he cant get anywhere with women,would it help if i gave him some pointers im just funnin ya
you called the police because someone hacked your world of warcraft account,what choice did i have the mighty sheldor level 85 blood elf hero of the eastern kingdoms has been picked clean like a carcass in the desert sun plus the fbi hung up on me

that was nice,good um the conductor said if i come back to the engine room hed show me how to bring the train through a crossing
going to wheatons party is not betraying you,oh of course you would have to believe that evil always thinks its doing right excuse me stormtrooper these are the droids youre looking for
what were you trying to ask me at the strip club,oh how much does it cost to get them off my lap
wait what is going on,in case you have forgotten schrodingers cat is a thought experiment
okay listen i dont mean to diminish what youre going through but im a little distracted right now,oh this again so penny proposed you didnt say yes and now you think you may have lost her love forever how does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days

amazing,i know this isnt the printout this is my real face
tuned bayonets,defend
is that supposed to be funny,i believe it is the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving the doublemeaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing
were not going to give up just like that,leonard the tv is in the building weve been denied access to the building ergo we are done

its no big deal im just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down,if you recall i pointed out the check engine light to you several months ago

you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey,my apologies leonard im only as good as my teacher
yeah its nothing to cry about,sheldon cooper does not cry
yes you walked around for a week saying sheldon unhappy with casting choice,but then mark ruffalo was the hulk in the avengers and he was even better
you know sheldon at any other time learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day but a couple of hours ago we were getting a turtle and silly as it sounds i thought that meant something,amy oh why didnt i give her sleepy time tea amy wait getting a turtle meant a great deal to me too
sheldon i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever,so youre saying you wouldnt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet
im sorry sheldon thats it thats all i got,oh its not your fault ive been to the model train store ive been to radio shack this woman is impossible to shop for
whatever you get any wast night,yes

no,formal protest
i didnt know what else to do hes lost all focus every day hes got a new obsession this is a particularly disturbing one,mommy
hallway,one at a time what was that
well alex is your employee if shes doing something thats making leonard uncomfortable you should talk to her,oh no hes not uncomfortable at all no hes loving it yeah hes strutting around like hes fivefootsix

penny started taking a class she wrote a paper she didnt want me to read it i went behind her back and i read it anyway,stephen hawking hates me
i think i know,its gonna get sucked in its going to get sucked in
everyone stop this was a stupid idea negative reinforcement isnt working,i think you mean positive punishment negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus its a common mistake

really,oh yes in fact i improved upon it
thank you sheldon now remember our deal,you do this i delete your contact information

thank you,aint she great
i am very disappointed in you you broke your toy and switched it with leonardâs you should be ashamed of yourself,youâre the one who told me to play with it
do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation,its one of the few forms of interaction with people that i dont find repellent

he might not be,oh maybe youre right he is kind of a lump
i dont think thats what you want at all,why of course its what i want why would i say its what i want if its not what i want
that does seem to be a valid principle,i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant workers solemn oath of ethics and cleanliness
sheldon listen to me i have a big decision to make and im scared,yellow go ahead
here we go,thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century interestingly they dont actually put the fork in their mouth they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth

then what happens,thats as far as ive gotten
hissy fits i have hissy fits,yes and i have a theory why because of your lactose intolerance you switched over to soy milk soy contains estrogenmimicking compounds i think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman

im proud of you sheldon,and a complete sucker
no im fine with it,that sounds like sarcasm but im going to disregard it because i have an agenda paintball specifically the interdepartmental tournament this weekend now in order to function better as a fighting unit i thought we should establish a chain of command now it goes without saying that i would outrank the three of you but the question remains by how much now i dont see me as some fourstar general back at hq riding a desk and playing golf with the secretary of defence but i also cant be sergeant cooper because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular joe this might take some thought as you were

lay it on me,assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another
leonard i always made you earn my affection but today i realize that theres more than one way to raise a child,i taught her that
no i didnt realize it had been so long sure i guess theres no other choice but to just go ahead and do it,hes referring to an activity he has done before its unpleasant and needs to be repeated this suggests some sort of invasive medical test like perhaps a colonoscopy

im going back to bed,wait put this in the bathroom
what oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn,ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch
so as hannah montana miley was a worldfamous pop star but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl which i dont have to tell you at that age is its own headache,thats preposterous how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig
id say it now but look at those cheekbones,i miss stuarts place all this loud music and exposed brick what is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pigs house
little misunderstanding huh,a little misunder galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding
oh damn they cancelled my visa oh yay a new mastercard,uhoh
soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty um,sleepy kitty
think about it if we had a family there our kids would be martians,they would wouldnt they we could give them cool martian names and we could teach them about martian history like who planted those flags and uh where did that copy of mars attacks come from
still saying stupid stuff ooh does she like bracelets,well shes very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin maybe they have a dressier version of that

hey were home any progress,how could there be with these constant interruptions
hmm recently not much,is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pairbond with a woman and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity
yup oh here you go,oh thank you here get yourself an eraser for your troubles
well i thought id start you off by polishing my belt buckles,oh by all means when i was a boy i would polish my meemaws silver and she would entertain me with stories about growing up in oklahoma interesting woman you know she once kll a prairie dog with a gravy boat
thank you,family or friend
sheldon is everything okay,its too late for koothrappali lets go
wow i have to say you are an amazing man youre gentle and passionate and my god you are such a good listener,leonard ive been working on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley
we could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked,mmm not bad you know in medieval times idle chatter was punished with a device called the scolds bridle its an iron cage thats locked around the head and pierces the tongue
sheldon we cant let him drive,then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks
sheldon,rats
well dinners almost ready,i must say i was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment as i mentioned the pasadena city council is debating longer crosswalk times and later the lego store is having a midnight madness sale you ask anyone thats a hot date
sheldon we said that we would play games with you tonight,oh no well still be playing it tonight this game can easily take eight hours
oh hey sheldon whats going on,i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics

sheldon i cant believe im saying this but im going to miss you,please penny as you know im not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion so i prepared a short video
theres a can in the fridge,a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge
youre not working late why did you lie to me,and amy you told me you were sick but you look just as pale and tired as always

no im not im bleeding,like a gladiator
what im trying to say is that maybe you cant approach this as a purely intellectual exercise,what do you mean
no,then no what else
ooh sheldon im afraid you couldnt be more wrong,more wrong wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation
oh for gods sake look hes a physicist whos trying to figure out what his next field of study should be,for your information i was asking her about the next star trek movie
thats the only logical inference,nevertheless i didnt say it anyway i would like you to come back and work for me
uh were not sure but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother im not pregnant,may i have one of your fries

the parade,yeah so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume you know most frightening most authentic most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle
no,then were probably okay
penny has a good point this is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck whatever youre thinking just keep it to yourself,it was like a grapefruit
oh hang on check your inbox,wait is this really worth it weve lived together for years with nary an argument

whats baffling me is what you couldve possibly put on the list hair too golden laugh too musical world too much a better place for her mere presence in it,how about constantly talks with food in her mouth
what do you think ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory,well when challenged monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing asault and a stylized penile display thats a little outside my comfort zone
so um was leonard okay with you coming over,oh yes in fact he said im fine i dont care and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal
i have yoohoo,its hard to say no to yoohoo the name literally beckons
oh boy,despite what her bible says recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the old testament they didnt exist in the middle east until hundreds of years later

well i dont know how to do that,how about this i promise i wont pester you about the dvd you can defecate in peace thats a win for both of us but until this matter is resolved i would like you to wear this sweater with nothing underneath it
i would at least mention it before filling out the application,huh thats exactly what leonard wolowitz koothrappali bernadette and penny said

yes,you people are sick
what,last night i was strongarmed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional amy farrah fowler this on a night that i had originally designated for solving the spacetime geometry in higherspin gravity and building my lego death star and why your gal pals penny and bernadette went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without amy an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me the future of string theory or my lego fun time
of ghosts no of you little bit,im sorry ive upset you i shouldnt have asked so many questions

where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff,my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday she thought if i failed at theoretical physics that i should have a trade to fall back on and by the way the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer
i dont know how am i supposed to remember all of this,thats the best part you dont have to see i told penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied so shes agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force
how did you get into my apartment,wow is that the kind of nagging i can expect now that youâre my girlfriend good thing i drew this up
rupert murdoch,he owns fox and they cancelled firefly hint he and darth vader are tied for number 2

me what did i do,you distract me ive been distracted since the moment i met you
um home to write some bad cheques,youre going to leave me
that is correct,so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that i can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists
why are you still doing this,because its working in the past few weeks unburdened by trivial decisions ive coauthored two papers in notable peerreviewed journals and im close to figuring out why the large hadron collider has yet to isolate the higgs boson particle
how does that happen,a bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find
sheldon what are you doing here so late,i couldnt sleep because i kept thinking about what happened earlier between us also i had one heck of a bus nap oh speaking of which do you want some mutton and coconut milk

great,there once was a brave lad named leonard with a fififiddledeedee he faced a fearsome giant while raj just wanted to pee
yes its true the last time i brought it up you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away,well given my history on the subject t seems a little reckless to bring it up now

what,ive been doing some research online and apparently female primates you know uh apes chimpanzees you they find their mate more desirable when hes being courted by another female now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation which brings me back to my question where are you in clearly im 14 days too early
well i was thinking about sheldonâs little joke the other night about me eating all your food,oh that was no joke but i understand your confusion as i am our groupâs resident cutup
no of course not how did you know about that,i did a comprehensive background check medical records credit reports criminal history i trust you paid off those parking tickets
hmm youre up late,oh im working on my lesson plan for wolowitz he is going to be so lost look at this section over here even i dont really understand it
aw,my shirt is itchy and i wish i were dead
why are you sitting in the stairwell,leonard told me to stay
how dare you aishwarya rai is a goddess by comparison madhuri dixit is a leprous prostitute,sorry i didnt mean to offend you obviously youre not that familiar with indian cinema
no reason oh you know what maybe this isnt such a good idea,oh no no no well now theres always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening
how would i be blinded,at the end of the ceremony all the students throw those pointy hats in the air its all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye
um uh uh uh we dont have an appointment and and we dont belong here but we were like crazybig fans i mean uh buh buh crazy for star wars crazy not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape although we do have a backpack that you really dont want to look in,youre blowing it we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him
aw see yeah you probably shouldnt have done that so write another email set the record straight its no big deal,youre right leonard its not a big deal all you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university that fyi was sarcasm i in fact believe it is a big deal
and this is dr gn from stockholm,ah sweden yeah home of my favourite muppet and uh second favourite meatball okay the nordic reputation for lack of humour is wellfounded boy is his name gn or nofunderson
i i didnt think it was a big deal,it is to me thats the point
bernie,if it makes you feel any better amy and i are fine i mean really good
something got you down there bunky,howard please im begging you
no,im not surprised
sheldon we have to get out of here,you might want to speak in a lower register
oh yes he says they are lost without you,well we sure saw that coming
howards right thatll never work,stop fighting me on the premise its scientifically valid im going to advance propositions i just want you to challenge me
oh for gods sake sheldon,focus is important was michael debakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants did alexander fleming moonlight as a hairdresser thanks for discovering penicillin now how about we try a bouffant
ahwimoweh ahwimoweh,bring it home mufasa eee eee eee eee eee um umaweh
sheldon at this point i would go by myself before i would take you,really
im sorry what was i thinking,uh just out of curiosity why didnt you ask leonard for advice about this
what,oh of course it only works on the weakminded
thank you,i reject them all
have you thought about putting him in a crate while youre out of the apartment,hello kripke yes sheldon cooper here it occurred to me you hadnt returned any of my calls because i hadnt offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship perhaps the two of us might share a meal together i see well then perhaps youd have time for a hot beverage popular choices include tea coffee cocoa i see no no no wait dont hang up yet what about a recreational activity i bet we share some common interests tell me an interest of yours really on actual horses tell me another interest of yours oh no im sorry i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to tell me another interest of yours
im packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell,well is that really necessary if you need money you can always sell blood and semen
okay glasses off find waldo,hurry up find him find him
uh i dont know could put a tennis ball on the end of excalibur make a pretty badass cane,do you supply the the tennis ball
thats it that wasnt so bad,no it wasnt uh now lets tabulate the results of the experiment i think its safe to say that youre not in love with me and im not in love with you and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences
im relieved that you dont have a problem with us working together,not as relieved as im about to be its a brave new world little lady
ill take it,good now i assume were splitting the cheque
no i mean why are you going to so much trouble to prove that youre smarter than wolowitz,oh its no trouble its actually a pleasure
whos adam west,whos adam west leonard what do the two of you talk about after the coitus
oh thats too bad i wonder what happened,mm its hard to say i can only speculate based on the data i collected watching my parents marriage implode in that case the woman dives into religion while the man dives into a bottleblonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures oop out of arrows
oh you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder,is not is not is not
whats the big deal,oh of course its no big deal to you you idolize me and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on
i wonder how long sheldons got,these shrimp are all the same size theres no the logical order to eat them in
what,i said good day
yes for you i do however have a few conditions first at all times i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal second my contributions shall be noted in all published material and third you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture,im impressed raj those are very cogent and reasonable conditions
is that why they sent you to boarding school,no that was the result of my work with lasers
wait how can how can anyone ruin raiders its perfect,yeah except for the fact that indiana jones is completely irrelevant to the story with or without him the nzi find the ark open it and die
sheldon what if he gets his internet from his cable company he could lose his hbo and all their delightful original programming,i dont care im losin it man
now that im actually about to go out with penny im not excited im nauseous,ah then your meal choice is appropriate starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion
come on sheldon you and me right here,penny for the thousandth time im saving myself for someone special perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud
okay you know what im gonna come at this in a whole new way sheldon if you try to make a baby with amy in a petri dish im gonna tell your mother on you,thats no threat my mothers always wanted a grandchild
twice a month,then no
to the north pole,yes
come on i touched one onion ring,and then you put it back compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings
oh hey buddy,buddy
hey did you ever make it to the dentist,not necessary no i found a service thatll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning mostly they cater to dogs but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind
oh all right thats cool no biggie he said hed help me set up my printer but i guess i can wait what exactly is he doing up there,in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me he is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo
not so loud but ideally yes thanks,thank you and what is my function as wingman
i will take that action,the flags of liechtenstein and haiti were identical by coincidence a fact that wasnt discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 olympics and thankfully their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of fascism
you alwight there cooper,not really i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function thats approaching an asymptote
so do we and ive seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things,its called parallel play
what is that,raiders of the lost ark with 21 additional seconds if i cant see it no one else can see it
thats fascinating but i,i didnt say it was fascinating i said it was noteworthy
no,yes
yeah you get some sleep,no i dont want to go to sleep you cant make me

well what do you think,i said i could follow it i didnt say i cared
oh wow,oh dear i was afraid of this
theres beer in the fridge anyway you guys really dont need to make a big deal,leonard youre being selfish we need to give you a proper sendoff so well have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face
no youre on vacation,please what if theres a big breakthrough in science today and im not there to see it
okay well do it,done
what,tada its short for dadadada

okay okay guys what are we doing here,i dont know what youre doing but i was about to insinuate that i had coitus with rajs mother for a dollar
its actually ho ho ho but youll get the hang of it thought itd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme,fun mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly the besttasting jelly and petroleum jelly the worsttasting jelly
yeah honey youll be fine as long as you dont do that bungee cord thing okay,penny didnt you recently state that you and i are friends
oh leonard,its still my turn
yeah and im not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship,yeah hes right once in a moment of candour i told amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill she stormed out which was sad because we were playing scrabble and i had all the letters to spell persimmon
okay i dont think amy wants a pocket watch,no but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch
aah its eating his face,i found your webcam and replaced the video feed you two should be ashamed of yourselves
what are you drawing over there,its a hypothetical containment field for a frisbeesized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe
why,he said its why they hired me its its what my grant was designated for and that everybody has to do things they dont want to do he then gave an example of something he had to do even though he didnt want to which was look at my stupid face
hey sheldon,penny
hes probably busy youre worried about nothing give it a couple more days im sure hell play and youll see that everythings fine my turn i cant let penny hand in a bad paper but how do i tell her its bad without letting her know that i read it,hmm bat me now i know hawkings not busy because i can see hes playing other people right now
no come on youre supposed to say of course he misses you the only reason hes partying is to cover up his pain,oh no i dont think thats true at all
sheldon is it possible that your foul mood or to use the clinical term bitchiness is because your mother isnt making you a priority,no or to use the clinical term nuhuh
technically faisal is my fiance but i do have a stateoftheart twophoton microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter,well that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your facebook page
youre trying to get back at me for what i said about raiders of the lost ark,thats silly almost as silly as dr baker having a telephone since telephones only existed in large cities at that time this is more like little house on the preposterous
sheldon just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesnt mean i have to participate,all right name your price
that was fast,its my prepacked disaster evacuation bag recommended by the department of homeland security and sarah connor

step one rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times,it actually says at least
its the social protocol its what you do when you have a friend whos proud of something they really suck at,i was not aware of that
yes,enjoy the accolades now wil wheaton but like your time on star trek
well then thats what were going to do,well i dont know what to say this is the most thoughtful gift that anyones ever given me and thats including an amazing gift that i gave myself earlier today

cause were going out again tomorrow,excuse me stuart have you read the new flash
no,yes
you said it,theres no denying i have feelings for you that cant be explained in any other way i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite but that seems even more farfetched the only conclusion was love i know whats happening this is a panic attack soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated
thats right theyre no good without the lighter,well so much for your advice on complimenting penny
yes,well then as my meemaw would say looks like we butchered a pig but nobody wanted bacon
they are only from me you said the gift of you was enough,yes but now that ive seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like theres no going back boy i cant wait to see the look on her face were leaving right now
what do you mean,is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future
you could try calling triplea but based on nasas latest timetable they wont get there for 35 years,plus i understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive
yeah i cant tell you how many times ive been at a party where everyones talking about flags and i just couldnt join in,yeah well you came to the right place

yeah its a deviated septum the surgery to correct it is simple hes gonna do it next week,why would you have surgery
are leonard and priya here,they went to catalina for the weekend
okay what kind of soup do you want,well my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons
it could be,so its like the musical equivalent of russells paradox the question of whether the set of all sets that dont contain themselves as members contains itself
sheldon you know what i think of when im scared voyager,voyager the space probe or voyager the star trek tv show
you brought your mother into this,stop it both of you all this fighting i might as well be back with my parents damn it george i told you if you didnt quit drinkin id leave you well i guess that makes you a liar cause im drunk as hell and youre still here stop yelling youre making sheldon cry ill tell you whats making sheldon cry that i let you name him sheldon
its kind of a funny name though smoot,its like talking to a chimp
that could have been about anyone besides you have nothing to worry about because now im the dusky half of koothrapenny,for the record i do have genitals theyre functional and aesthetically pleasing
oh come on you mightve gone to school for a couple more years than me but guess what engineers are just as smart as physicists,you take that back
can i speak to you for a second,ill be right back feel free to play with yourself
yeah woohoo,the invitation to join the arctic expedition
thats pretty cool sheldon,thank you do either of you know beyoncé id love her to get behind it
well arent you sweet,anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival
yeah freaky,have a chocolate
fine a dollar,can you break a twenty
mr wolowitz this is your second warning,a sigma particle
i can never find the tiller i got a book it didnt help,yeah i always thought if i were ever enslaved it would be by an advanced species from another planet not some hotsytotsy from glendale
give me that,no its mine
where exactly did your mother have you tested,leonard the transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be you know like uh a semi truck might be an alien robot or uh someone in a romantic relationship uh might feel differently than they appear to or a conversation about the transformers might actually be about someone in this room im going to pause to let that sink in
now honey i already told you the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature,no this is to train for a threemonth expedition to the magnetic north pole
oh and i thought our days of pretending to be with women who dont exist were over,gentlemen i am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention

keep going,and rubber gloves uh air freshener um noisecancelling headphones oh danger whistle um pepper spray ooh a multilanguage occupied sign uh lets see we have seat protectors uh booties for my shoes a clothespin for my nose oh and a mirror on a stick so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me isnt some kind of weirdo
can i sit in your spot,no
you dont think its worthwhile to try to get more women working in science,i think thats incredibly sexist of you i believe in a genderblind society like in star trek where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals
hes right,yeah well of course i am i was also right about her hair it did everything but quack
great,thank you
god are you trying to make amy jealous,no why is everyone so obsessed with amy and stuart and whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight
no that was a different guy,was he the one who wedgied you so hard your testicle reascended and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down
i like the wii,thanks grandma
here this will help,very well but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics youre going to have to answer to my mother
look at all these people in love it kind of gets you thinking doesnt it,it does indeed leonard is it awkward being here with penny given that you recently proposed to her
would you just relax,oh i see a space in the white zone quick circle the airport
get in here hurry dont you dare knock,hello

how does it work,oh its very simple scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves spock spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors
come on look the letter was found in bernadettes closet doesnt that count for something,are you pointing out that california is a community property state and since howard and bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses
please dont tell anyone i spent the night with rajs sister,there it is what if someone asks
i tried to read your paper but it was very hard for me to understand,oh its quite straightforward actually it describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an ndimensional superfluid
you know were not that far from vazquez rocks,oh they sht a lot of star trek episodes out there
uhoh hang on,are you in danger
this looks like some serious stuff leonard did you do this,actually thats my work

now shall we get back to work,i suppose battlestar galactica comes on tonight i guess i can wait for the dvd and then never ever watch it
you okay,if i was okay i wouldve said hello and not the much more ominous hello
id use feynmans trick differentiate under the integral sign,okay um what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics
no the light has been on since i bought the car,all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes
all right look i didnt know im sorry,well im sorry but that is your second strike
anything else,yes i want you to apologize to leonard
oh no no no i know this uh hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks,yes hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks

well theres no toilets well have to do our business in a bucket,so its settled were not doing it
because we didnt want to be disturbed,and that didnt work out did it
okay the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd i mean humour is a complex neurological okay thats pretty good,excellent
might be something to think about,leonard
im sorry that must be very difficult for you,its awful this morning she arranged for me to be an amtrak junior conductor for the day it its usually only open to children she got them to make an exception
insurance is gonna buy you a new car its not gonna defunk my junk,gentlemen a little less bellyaching were starfleet officers and a member of the borg collective
no no no amy wait i know its not the night you had in mind but why dont you guys stay and play with us itll be fun,it would fun okay three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter now you want the girls to play dd do you have a drug problem

once again unbelievable,yeah once again i know
sheldon its a date i have a date coming over,oh well you cant blame me for not jumping to that conclusion
fine um on the count of three one two,wait just to clarify when you get to three do we stand up or do we pee
what,you have to sign this
do you want me to go to the funeral with you,oh im not going to the funeral
look im still happy to drive you to work nothings changed in that regard were still roommates were still friends,except you identified me your best friend as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex
what,are you sleeping
good luck getting time on it the only people he lets use it are his friends,well then the solution is simple i shall befriend him kripke
what is it,when i signed for the package i was deputized by the united parcel service and entrusted with its final delivery i now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that im fully indemnified and no longer liable
his heart stopped bat i have to urinate,what a remarkable woman
well hes in my bed why cant i be in his,the hammurabic code is an eye for an eye not a bed for a bed
yes in part,have you ever considered trying to do something useful perhaps reading to the elderly
sorry,this is kind of creepy
what are you doing,im simplifying the task of packing for our trip see by attaching rfid tags to my clothing it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand i will then crossreference them against destination anticipated activity spectrum weather conditions duration of trip et cetera
okay,lets see oh this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous disfigured freak
mmhmm and,and i think ive got it consider a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined he causes nothing but problems why do they keep him
that doesnt sound like mocking,you didnt let me finish dinfast are those soybased candles
you are my brother,okay so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest or fort off are fort knox fort ticonderoga fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket
so,they would be gastronomically redundant i can see were going to have to spell out everything for this girl
come on you know how it is with breakups,no i dont and neither do you
thats not an apology,that is your opinion
ugh what are you doing here,you told me not to call and i didnt know how else to give you the good news fun with flags is back and you can be in the next episode
probably not,huh it would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me
not bad i had a lot more fun with amy than i thought i would,what exactly do you mean by that
i guess thats why they call you a genius,they call me a genius because im a genius tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds and that im having regular bowel movements enjoy the wedding goodbye
fine it bothers me you happy,you think youve got problems the gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape
yeah they are,hes right
no,darn i cant seem to get the hang of that
oh no it isnt,when i was a little boy and got sick which was most of the time my mother would read it to me its about an indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different for some reason i related to it quite strongly
dr cooper the physics department chair tells me youre refusing to take your vacation,i dont need a vacation
probably but in their own homes,so what time does the costume parade start

that doesnt count do over do over,there are no doovers in wii bowling
sheldon what did you expect,i expected to see howard throw the baseball finish my hot dog and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickeys soundsational parade
nothing rhymes with orange its probably lonely,all right come in you look positively orange with loneliness no i dont see that catching on at all
thatâs my boyfriend itâs open,i got a splinter
arent you going to thank penny for taking you to disneyland,thank you penny
penny have you seen my good inhaler,break it off shake hands walk away
just say thank you,i thought i just did
okay and to defend i roll two sixes i win,boy doublesixes again you know if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes i wouldnt believe it i wonder how long were gonna be stuck here
sheldon where are my clothes,you know i do recall seeing some female undergarments where was that oh yes earlier this evening i happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye do those look familiar
yes and to open it would destroy itâs value but remember like me you also have a human half,well iâm not going to dignify that with a response
its not going to explode just keep driving warp speed ahead mr spock,mr spock did not pilot the enterprise he was the science officer and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprises check engine light blinking he would pull the ship over immediately
he had lysine but changed it,yeah shoulda woulda coulda raj
all right,so thats what you wear to an interview
make this interesting you bet money on me,no no we designed an experiment involving you see now isnt that interesting
really thats the commitment issue youre wrestling with sheldon do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed while after five years all i can get out of you is a distracted makeout session on a couch,ironys not really my strong suit but i have been getting better with sarcasm if you want to give that a try
yeah thats basically what i said,yeah the point is higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago so that got me thinking perhaps ive already hit upon the idea that will win me my nobel prize
i dont know olivia geiger,the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye
thats interesting but this could be taking you down the path toward a nobel prize and in chemistry no less and wouldnt that be unusual because youre a physicist,yes yes id be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry everyone laugh at the circus freak you know i dont need to sit here and take this flatow it is because of bullies like you every day more and more americans are making the switch to television
getting kind of grim,then ill look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner that mines my poor bones
well what did she mean by that was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention,you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio
but it didnt seem real,let me ask you a question at any point was las vegas on its side
of course it is its a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable its very wrong to say its a suspension bridge but returning to the original issue dick grayson became nightwing a superhero in his own right batman 2 has to be the second robin jason todd,has to be has to be i hope youre being deliberately provocative
what,gentlemen if i may interject ive decided my rank will be captain if its good enough for kirk crunch and kangaroo its good enough for me
no i i get that,but um i did have you and every day at four oclock youd come to my house on channel 68 and wed do science together if it hadnt been for you well who knows what wouldve become of me you know instead of a worldclass physicist i couldve wound up as a hobo or a surgeon
then what is it,i want a different question
no no im not,use the force sheldon use the force im gonna need more force
im on it,thats happy right
i just want to make sure you get there safe,well this is me its been a very interesting evening
okay uncomfortable silence it is hey sheldon have you told amy what it was like for you growing up in texas,no
as am i,what are you doing
mmm when really were just exiting an uncomfortable situation,kripke you know of all the people barry kripke im so are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you
why arent you working,um she distracted me i told you penny i dont have time for your nonsense i have important things to do
mmm no it isnt,okay then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car bearing your license plates coming to me
fine,needy baby greedy baby indeed
mm i know how you feel i spent the day throwing out a mans entire career and all thats left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that raj took when he thought no one was looking,its not the same thing i dont think you know how i feel at all
thats not true,yeah well maybe it is maybe it isnt i have been hallucinating lately
its not you now think theres a car named after him,of course there is the mini cooper cause its me
me neither except for one night when the heat went out long story its dont ask,leonard leonard leonard

it doesnt matter the womans not interested in me the woman rejected me,okay look i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker nevertheless i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you you did not ask her out
we cant show up to your moms emptyhanded we should bring something,i already am im bringing the gift of knowledge

so as hannah montana miley was a worldfamous pop star but then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl which i dont have to tell you at that age is its own headache,thats preposterous how would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig
no,i assumed as much but never fear like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel i have returned to save the day odd usually hes met by cheers anyway i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations and it occurred to me that i could benefit
youre all alike,well what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling like i cant always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me you know like uh if theyre mad at something ive done or just in a bad mood it its incredibly stressful
i wonder what changed her mind,perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love
anyway if its okay with you we should talk about howards bachelor party,well seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation but what do you know youre half swan
wow so how long will you be gone,well shes due tomorrow although it did take her six years to finish high school so who knows

great great did you walk the whole way its a little chilly,koothrappali picked me up

whatever you cant even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement,if youve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract id like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the u s constitution and it may not be cool to say so but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today
where did that even come from did he say we were,no leonard said nothing but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered
no im not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar,wise decision you see amy success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height strength attractiveness the ability to hold ones liquor and throw darts separately or together leonard has none of these attributes right leonard
you know there was a time when i was alone and had no friends im starting to miss that,he still hasnt responded whats taking him so long
yes,and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do
youre really going to do this,i am yeah penny pointed out that what im going through is essentially a breakup and according to cosmopolitan magazine one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship
i dont know what that is but if it means i can go home and sleep then yes,think carefully here clause 209 suspends our friendship and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall sup
okay well for one thing we expect quantii spacetime to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours,balderdash matter clearly consists of tiny strings

you know this might work out for the best i mean youre always complaining about what a terrible roommate leonard is like how he turns up the thermostat when youre not there,ugh its like walking into the amazon and not the good amazon with oneday shipping the awful one with birds and snakes
all right sheldon theres only one thing left i want you to do dont worry its an easy one,okay
im having dinner with priya at rajs i think howards going to be there you want to join us,but tonights thursday on thursdays everybody comes over here and has pizza or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be luigi but who sounds suspiciously like jackie chan

why not,because im trying to decide between getting an xbox one or a ps4 oh pee whyd i say that
i dont mean to be rude sheldon but uh my life is kind of falling apart right now,your life the university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me and now the place i need to go when im sad is damp and smells funny
whats the matter you chicken,ive always found that an inappropriate slur chickens are not by nature at all timid in fact when i was young my neighbours chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house

correct,formal protest
and you guys arent going i cant believe you raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and youre not even going to be there to support him,a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind
because its taken 15 years but high school is finally awesome i love them both but im in the centre now and i love that even more,amy please i am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine

yes,where exactly does the halfsandwich come from are you giving me half of someone elses sandwich or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half
um me okay im sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know,yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the suns apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality
hey sheldon,come in take a seat subject has arrived ive extended a friendly casual greeting

youre right i really should be asking strangers on the internet,my original point
well what a thrill,youre sitting in my spot

you cannot exist as a virtual presence not here and certainly not at work oh good god,at my age do you know how im statistically most likely to die
okay were headed out see you later,before you leave could you test these noisecancelling headphones
like what,like has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently
no kidding,well no no im not going to go so far as to say that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind you know a hm novus if you will no thats for anthropologists to decide but i am convinced that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because im not meant to

fine you win,darn tootin i win

oh sheldon wait,no youve opened my eyes to the truth amy has made me a more affectionate openminded person and that stops now
no,is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion
im nowitzki,oh you want me to share credit
no about my job i want you to tell me im good at what i do,youre obviously good at what you do
im going to write you a cheque for that as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it like the others,i also now have three points on a drivers licence i do not yet possess and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals
ill see you later i gotta go watch a stupid football game with penny,wait hang on youve spent time with amy can you think of anything shes fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasnt noticed
sheldon that computer is used for national defence hacking into it is a federal crime,relax were not under attack right now

why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility,put it on the back burner anyway it occurs to me if i ever did perfect a time machine id just go into the past and give it to myself thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place
i am not going to apologize ive done nothing wrong he is completely overreacting,irrelevant the disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable
did you send everyone to the principals office already,no one signed up
come on bath stuff its perfect you got a scented candle a cleansing buff spearmint and green tea scented bath oil promotes relaxation,that presupposes penny is tense
thats what youre thinking about,well one of the things
you enjoy giving people grades,a valid point but unoriginal bminus
sheldon get over here,she might be contagious dont you think im having a rough enough day
interesting can you see how a grown man an accomplished scientist who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources,no
will amy be joining us for dinner,yes i believe so
uh youre sad about not getting anything done last night so youre gonna sit around and pout about it,boy im not nearly as mysterious as i think i am
youre going to need to stop talking immediately,for how
what did you have in mind,well off the top of my head id have to go with excalibur it gives you the right to rule england
no,all right then the reason youre fixated on a goodnatured simpleton like penny is that shes the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment your brilliant yet intimidating mother
trust me it gets old after a while you must right your wrong sheldon,why i got away with it leonard has his toy and heâs never going to open it so he wonât know itâs broken and i have a toy that isnât broken everybodyâs happy
wait honey have you ever run before,certainly ive run from bullies dogs angry chickens and one particularly persistent p e teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test

merry christmas sheldon,i cant believe this youre happy im happy well maybe a holiday thats all about giving isnt so get your hand out of that box
sheldon not that we dont all enjoy a good lion semen story whats your point,my point is if koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow undeserved fame perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort
you got it,there we go compromising again we really are the best
your home is twenty feet from here,twenty feet twenty light years it doesnt matter its in a galaxy far far away

sheldon sit down,shes in my spot dont look at me like that everybody knows that my spot
its not funny that mistake got published,stop im going to wet myself
stephanie barnett is single,yeah furthermore earlier this evening she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike whos mike why does he get a digital sheep and not you

okay uh please dont take this the wrong way but id rather swim bucknaked across the ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you,for me
so dont look at it,shes like my fourth favourite catwoman
shh amys here now,you know the more i think about it the more intrigued i am about having our own store
my new book the hidden reality takes on a grand question is our universe the only universe you see theres a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos in the hidden reality i explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader,hysterical
that was rude,he does it all the time hes a cornucopia of social awkwardness
i can take them or leave them,at the movies wolowitz always eats raisinets
no what are you doing no no pick that back up you know its good you did the research,but what if im wrong
what is it,i made tea

did you go to your prom,no i had a date with a proper education instead of a tuxedo i dressed myself in good habits instead of spiked punch i enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge instead of dancing in a gym i shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms
all im saying is you know leonard the best,not necessarily im often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard just the other day i discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but i dont condemn those who seek to accelerate the process and until recently i had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance he can tolerate small amounts of nonfat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that i maintain in the right concentration could be wapon
whatever you like,i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation
like everybody elses subject to entropy decay and eventual death thank you for asking why is she not taking our order,i shouldve warned you one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here
so listen sheldon i was thinking since this is gonna be our first halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend i thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume,i couldnt agree more
wait what,he lied and im feeling very uncomfortable about it
this is the difference between eating and dining,remarkable im just realizing how much leonards been skating by all these years
youre right i do feel better,well the germans have always been a comforting people just remember leonard where your biological family has failed you you always have me your surrogate family

i dont know i heard you reading pretty loud last night,oh dear lord wheres amy
what did i do,i opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me and you treated it as if it were nothing

yay,she made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere your nebraska backwoods kll and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild
oh thats a funny turn isnt it you never think about it going the other way well you cant force things you need to figure out if youre in a relationship or if youre just calling it one its like they say a cat can have kittens in the oven but that dont make em biscuits,and that reminds me of another saying you can lead a chicken to crisco but you cantmake your mother fry it
leonard said cockamamie,actually im paraphrasing having been raised in a christian household im uncomfortable with the language he used and to be honest im not entirely comfortable with cockamamie
okay well anyways i brought you a dayold cheesecake to cheer you up,stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich
now you just get comfortable,no no comfort is the enemy you know whats comfortable slippers and blankets and panda bears imagine a panda bear with richard feynmans face on it warm up the car leonard its poster time
i hate trains,dont be ridiculous you love trains
cant we just postpone it till the spring maybe next summer,this should be fairly easy to deduce hes holding the phone to his left ear ears do not cross hemispheres so hes using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller

like what yeah yeah i see you youre making a little cheque sign in the air i got it just hold your horses what does leonard complain about,your driving the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities your constant tardiness your singing
youre having a guiltridden dream,do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis
right,you also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated but go on
so what happens next,oh more testing more success more fame yeah but dont worry i will remain the same downtoearth humble joe ive always been
youre not going to switzerland,oh but i am didnt penny tell you the good news

whatever you cant even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement,if youve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract id like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the u s constitution and it may not be cool to say so but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today

studying abroad,no visiting professor anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausagebased than im used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia
yes well i want a boyfriend whose roommate isnt a giant pain in the ass,im sure that will happen soon enough but in the meantime i still want oatmeal
im a scientist my ability to think is my bread and butter im afraid if i take this i might lose that special unique something that makes me so successful in my field,rajesh ive had the privilege of working alongside you for many years my recommendation is that you gobble these up like tic tacs
currently youre being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory if we promote you to junior professor youll be able to choose whatever field of research youd like,but if im a professor then ill have to teach a class
well thats it then were doomed,i think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my physics department paintball strategy meeting
dude i was about to bollywood this bitch,earlier today i invited professor stephen hawking to join me in the popular online game words with friends moments ago he accepted my request do you understand what that means
alright alright well uh nevertheless i have one now and i would appreciate it if you would you know make yourself scarce,leonard i am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an iq which cant be accurately measured by normal tests how much scarcer could i be

you know what youve convinced me maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet,you dont think that crosses a line
its closed,i dont understand why you people are picking on my friend howard when there are much more serious security threats to pursue for instance when i first met leonard he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a north korean spy and not one agent ever investigated that
more and more sure,well then you have my permission

ill say,fun and information are two sides to this video podcast not unlike the only twosided state flag oregon oh look hello mr beaver in future episodes well answer some burning questions whats the only nonrectangular flag what animal appears most often on flags what animal appears second most often on flags and more
anyway wish me luck,leonard wait am i correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by pennyâs peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her
she asked me to do her a favour sheldon,ah yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause
i dont know i was hungry whats the big deal,the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate
i propose we spend a weekend at a bedandbreakfast in napa valley,i hate every word in that sentence including in at we and a

wait a minute you talked to penny about our sex life,leonard it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial i lost a bet to wolowitz
dr cooper before i find you in contempt and throw you in jail im going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark,i am a scientist i never apologize for the truth
oh,hey thats my shirt
yeah once he figures out how to work a door,i was not panicked and i am not overly attached to leonard
shelly can i speak to you for a minute alone,why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone usually nobody wants to be alone with me

tell you what forget the s c aw f l aw aw i lets settle this woboto a woboto,what do you mean
i know i just need you stop talking,penny penny penny
now the reason i called amy over was to find out what type of person she is and after chatting a bit i have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman you two are definitely not suited for each other,thats a peculiar conclusion by any standard amy is more similar to me than anyone ive ever met
who is it,sheldon sheldon cooper
this is brilliant sheldon how are we going to deploy it in kripkes office,already taken care of observe this is a live sht of kripkes lab via a mini webcam i was able to install thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitors shirt pocket at the same time i also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling

shiksa shiksa,forgive me yiddish was not spoken in east texas and if it was it wasnt spoken for long
i remove your armour what do you do,i erotically caress your nose

oh sheldon stop it,when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together
bells are ringing children singing all is merry and bright so hang your stockings and say your prayers cause santa claus is coming tonight whyd you turn it off,because in the last ten minutes santa came to town kissed mommy and ran grandma over with a reindeer i had a drunk uncle who did all those things nobody sings songs about him
are you familiar with the 12 labours of hercules,of course

thank you,and to answer it we first must ask ourselves what is physics
wait what are you doing i canât scissors by myself howard come back,victory
who do we love,penny
all right well if im understanding this right and all she did was help out another scientist im thinking you might have to let this one go,ugh let it go i have heard that my whole life every time something upsets me somebody says let it go you know like its my fault and its not okay to feel the way i feel
sheldon i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better may i offer you a consoling hug,what do we have to lose
oh what,i want her to feel at home i also bought scented soaps pantyhose midol calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel
gummy bears thank you,now that youre in my debt please manipulate amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunts tedious birthday party
have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered,well no
oh honey the buses dont go where you live do they,look penny i wish i could be more lenient with you but since youve become a permanent member of our social group i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else
i dont know maybe i have no idea what you said,so your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all
why dont i just tell you what i heard today,that would probably save us some time
oh i give up,i dont guess as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as im saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot
then dont say anything,i have to how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i dont tell her how disappointed i am and that ill never forgive her
sheldon take a break,namaste
what are you doing,science you wouldnt understand
hey uh sheldon you want anything,uh no thank you

i dont get it theres actually peanut brittle in please go to mars,but on a more serious note the most important reason i want to go to mars is that i believe as a scientist its my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward now i know that life on mars will be difficult but life here on earth is no picnic also picnics are no picnic where should we go for lunch oh i know the ground in conclusion thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime to mars

thank you would you characterize him as responsible,im going to answer that with a visual aid this is my ninedisc complete lord of the rings trilogy bluray set mr wolowitz borrowed it damaged plastic retention hub number three and then returned it to me hoping i wouldnt notice would you characterize that as responsible

you were in the middle of an erection,oh of course its right here in my hand

if penny didnt know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she penny thought that i should her lesley out indicating that she penny had no interest in me asking her penny out but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she lesley had turned me down then she penny could be offering consolation thats too bad you would have made a cute couple but while thinking good leonard remains available,youre a lucky man leonard
well forget it i was the one who was invited i get to decide who goes with me and its penny not you,howard could you lower the lights i have a short powerpoint presentation

but i cant have one,youre two for two
well she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother so shes kind of family,you know i apologise for my earlier outburst who needs halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha
no hang on i followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement i made a written record request 72 hours in advance i checked the tyre pressure on the car i even contacted the centres for disease control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to orange county fyi its none,amy the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way
let me see let me see one calls it insightful and innovative were insightful and innovative,oh nice to meet you mr insightful

why dont you enlighten me,with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at bill gates house should i be invited
okay so you absolutely should talk to him look i know leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that without your little idea theres no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing,excuse me little idea
no they forgot i was there but it really opened up my pores,well according to my research the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines
and why is that,it was listed under seafood
give it back,im sorry but could you be more specific
is leonard coming,no i believe leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize
you know you fan boys are unbelievable do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want i mean why dont you just come on in and watch the lakers game with me,well im not much of a sports fan but thank you

well what are you going to do sheldon give up,yes thats what a rational person does when his entire lifes work is invalidated by a postpubescent asian wunderkind he ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die
i thought she was the whore of omaha,shhh
you called my mother,oh leonard is it really necessary to caption the obvious

doesnt matter,youre not listening to my side of it
yeah hes over it thats why hes been whining all day about trying to invent that memorywiper gizmo from men in black,is he making any progress because id like to erase ben affleck as daredevil

sweetheart are you sick,i hope so because if this is well life isnt worth living
sheldon can i talk to you in private,i guess dont worry i was going to order you cheeseless
no the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush look we kept the original data you can still publish the actual results,yes but the actual results are unsuccessful and ive already sent an email to everyone at the university explaining that i have confirmed string theory and forever changed mans understanding of the universe
you know i can see why amys mad at you,yeah shut up sheldon
you know when one male dominates another his testosterone level rises,whats your point
do i have a choice,well of course you have a choice although we live in a deterministic universe each individual has free will now sit down i call your attention to the events of november 16 do you remember that date
come on sheldon this is important to me,penny this would be a massive undertaking and my time is both limited and valuable
im pushing play,a minute
fine howard is being mean to you for no reason,i knew it
i can figure this out lets see um well beavers eat tree bark the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon so ill say cinnamon,incorrect obviously the answer is cheese danish

all right next were gonna introduce an anxietyinducing stimulus measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problemsolving rate,very well and good luck im a pretty laidback guy
no were always doing what you guys want just once itd be nice if you did something we wanted,you want to be green

priya and i are both adults we didnt betray raj,in fact you did but i was referring to howard
oh my dear boy no okay next this is a sexy french maid costume i bought for bernadette i thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time but i was wrong and really wrong,and you want me to return it for you
okay,excuse me isnt this the point where the worldweary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron

oh my god im crying already,raj raj raj i need to sleep here tonight
why do they say aa,army ants

youre kidding,i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital when i was 12 i got to ride there in a helicopter
well it was going to be mine,thank you for the invitation but i have to decline because it doesnt sound like something ill enjoy
really what was i doing to your neck last night while you were playing xbox,its like im living in a dictatorship you must take a vacation you must have fun you must enjoy life
no this has to stop now,im not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool i thought the bazinga was implied im just tweaking her personality sanding off the rough edges if you will
thats very sweet but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with not you,i dont understand how could we all live together if im not there
man youre kll me,kll you i cant breathe

oh thats right howd it go with penny,much better than i expected she even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language watch welcome to my world not welcome to my world welcome not welcome
no you have to read it how dr angus mcdougal of the university of edinburgh would this wee lil bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off,he wrote back cooper and hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper it should come as no surprise given they work at cal tech essentially a technical school where even the physicists are basically engineers engineers do you know how insulting that is
im sorry ive got to run if you come up with an adjective text me,inconsiderate that is the adjective inconsiderate
exactly,well i was hoping to avoid this but i might as well get it over with thank you penny ill let you know what happens
did you really have to bring it in with you,what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low
upsilon,good one and an electrical charge
i wonder if its from like ancient rome where theyd actually chop somebodys ass off and then go here you know to appease loseroneous the god of losers,i am not a loser pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or kll
nope it was better before,look at it i feel like my mind just made a baby and its beautiful its not like human babies which are loud and covered in goop
huh that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me lets get our minds off how uncomfortable we are we could take some more simulated instrument readings,my major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay
oh im sorry guys but the store closed five minutes ago,but i havent decided yet
right there with you,kirk bat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the simulator thats it
im not jealous i just think its silly for you to compare relationships like theyre something that can be quantified,everything is quantifiable that french fry a seven spiderman a nine the number nine oddly only a four
listen i was thinking you and i could probably try to be better friends,really i was thinking what we have now is a bit much
so i cant go,leonard you may be right it appears that penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion
that is a tough one uh i know he brushes both of them,gentlemen i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me id like you to be my intellectual sparring partners from now on when i make an assertion i need you to challenge it
no i didnt,i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir
do you want to switch,no thats fine im perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle
im sorry,said the grinch to christmas
thats good thats good thats good,mommy why are you crying cause im gonna miss you shellybean even though you creep the bejeezus out of me
which way are you going,which way are you going
you have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you its exhausting,you know what you think youre so tolerant but the truth is youre mean to me a lot yeah you think that i dont notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls but i do hmm i have excellent peripheral vision on a good day i can see my ears
hey sheldon ive been thinking instead of arguing about this why dont,dont you ever speak to me again
you want some oreos,double stuf
uh can i just say ive missed all of us hanging out together,yeah
so howard tell us hows it feel knowing that when you two get married youll be referred to as mr and dr wolowitz,unless he takes bernadettes last name and considering her advanced status that could open some doors for him
whats going on,ive made you breakfast juice coffee and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters see heres frodo
kmn,now in this pivotal scene sheldons mother played by you argues with an emissary of the united federation of planets mr spock the role i will bring to life
nothing bad happens in the lake house,yeah well no not to them to me time traveling mailbox the only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet
boy last time i put vaporub on you you didnt have hair on your chest,i know it filled in last year i didnt get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit
probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant and none of us wanted to walk back,i know the real reason you never made progress with that idea you thought of it september 22nd 2007 two days later penny moved in and so much blood rushed to your genitals your brain became a ghost town
oh all right well im glad you like it i mean i still cant get over the fact someone just threw it away,what
um yeah but theyre all for little kids,i assume the kll can be extrapolated and transferred
im so glad you guys are friends again,and im glad you and i are friends again too
no i only have hundreds,you know what i dont always recognize sarcasm but i do right now and i dont appreciate it im sorry for your loss but youre not the only one whose day has been a disaster
all right next were gonna introduce an anxietyinducing stimulus measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problemsolving rate,very well and good luck im a pretty laidback guy

okay,i suppose so
well as near as i could tell you you fell asleep watching star wars and now youre youre dreaming youre watching star wars,so
sheldon you dont get over the flu in half an hour,well not with that attitude
i think hes got me,the year was 1995 the place jackson mississippi having spent ten hours on a bus during which i had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle i finally arrived at the fourth annual dixietrek convention only to find that my idol wil wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure
where are you going,wherever the music takes me kitten i play bongos walking down the stairs oh oh never play bongos walking down the stairs
cooper and his team,you should know i had nothing to do with that
no no were not playing some dumb madeup game,all games are made up theyre not found in nature you dont just dig in the ground come across a rich vein of rockem sockem robots
ill risk it,hm
all right come on come on put some real emotion into it blahblah blah blah vast and troubled galaxy go,oh shelly a mans here to take you away to the future be sure to pack clean underwear
i dont know morse code,its very simple this is a this is b this is c
well hang on lets see where hes going,then it hits her how is she going to survive i mean she has no prospects no marketable kll and then one day she meets a group of geniuses and their friend howard
hey were uh going to the movies,no were not were standing in the hallway suffering through an awkward encounter
for what,if someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning i think i can face a simple award ceremony
yeah okay but whats with the backscratching and the meow,i believe the backscratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action
thank you,its happening leonard its happening professor proton is coming to our house
okay fasten your seat belt,click now are there air bags
my carpal tunnels acting up,play through the pain

okay yeah fine,its the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one
no youre not sanding penny,are you saying that im forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better
i like mark ruffalo too,yeah settle down there fake wolowitz no one likes a kissup
isnt that flammable,highly oh dear
i know you want to get a picture,i want more than a picture i want to go in
never mind,slow down slow down please slow down
oh sheldon are these letters from your grandmother,dont read those letters
i know every saturday at 8,what are you implying
you never heard it that time,arthur i thought you were dead
actually i was just checking my email but uh no the rover is not responding,i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion
can i get a hallelujah,fraternal twins come from two separate eggs they are no more alike than any other siblings
oh sorry im late i just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper,did you enjoy the humorous footnote where i illustrate mirrorsymmetry by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself

so what do you think,its a charming illusion but it does not cheer me up
look lets be reasonable we all want to do different things with the ring but your ideas are stupid and i want a jet ski,i found it the ring is mine i dont understand why in this group i never get my way
so have you worked out the neutrino issue,well to paraphrase mozart all the subatomic particles are there i just have to put them in the right order
another great,changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the earth rotates on its axis so bad weather can actually make the day longer
seventeen the larger ogre is dead thethe other ogre says you kll my brother now ogre thanksgiving is ruined,that is amazing he made me care about the ogre

how you feeling,not so good
all right let me see if ive got this straight a picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate christmas,correct
whats the bright side,only nine more months to comiccon

look just forget i told you about me not graduating from community college okay,forget you want me to forget this mind does not forget i havent forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me it was a drizzly tuesday
leonard just realized that pennyâs been hiding him from her friends because heâs a tiny little man who flies kites,oh that certainly would suck
here we go again why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date were committed to each other were happy a ceremony isnt gonna change anything,so youre never getting married its his whining isnt it
which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negativeenergy density as spacetime so what do you think what do you think so what do you think,hmm
wow its all happening so fast should we just sleep on it,we could but we always run the risk of someone else bat us to the punch
you dont honestly think that do you,leonard i assumed you knew the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy howard and bernadette raj and his girlfriend penny and chardonnay penny and you
right i heard youve been pulling all nighters with middleearth barbie,she comes into my room noones supposed to be in my room
i dont even know what youre talking about and i agree,okay i have to tell you something but youre not going to like it

well do you think when she and i had that conversation she left people off her list,im sure she did

its indeed admirable although it is microbiology,your doctorate is in neurobiology i fail to see the distinction
sheldon why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk,because most of the things im planning to buy havent been invented yet

cats sheldon youre clearly upset about amy being gone and youre trying to replace her with a bunch of cats,clowder
no,the answers tricky its second street you see youd think it would be first street but in most towns first street eventually gets renamed to something else you know like main street broad street michigan avenue leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brainteasers like that we also play games would you like to play one
oh please i recognize the walk of shame when i see it all youre missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it,whats going on
what,well you seem like a perfectly pleasant person i just cant understand why women have such a hard time loving you
well yeah,well then its settled
okay hang on are you saying someday you and amy might actually get physical,its a possibility
uhhuh,is it because shes dating you but was out with that other fellow
down here on your desk,spock
he was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room,made necessary by her insistence on going into my room

and over here is sheldon,hi
sheldon im not taking you to switzerland,well of course you are who else would you take
as long as were apologising sheldon i im sorry i used your toothbrush,and im sorry but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated we are no longer friends

sheldon,sssshhhh pennys sleeping
one was already in an accident,that doesnt mean one wont be in another especially if im driving
so i did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there for starters its very humid and about a hundred degrees,well im from texas and youre from india were no strangers to the fragrant armpit next
what,while a thoughtful gift this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars
okay im leaving for the conference,have fun presenting my lucky hunch
yello,you need to remove that chair from the building its a health hazard
sheldon were all scientists i helped out a fellow colleague youre being petty,im being petty you know barry and i have a professional rivalry you heard him he told me to suck eggs if we were friends he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant why are you laughing did you learn something
hows that,i feel like im being strangled by a boa constrictor whyd you stop
are you saying hes manstruating,not literally but as far back as the 17th century scientists observed a 33day fluctuation in mens hormone levels
im warning you sheldon,your threats are empty nothing can move me stop that

you suck wolowitz,he makes a valid point
sheldon we are just people we talk about the same things you guys talk about,you talk about if werewolves can swim see leonard says yes but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten what do you think
i see well it seems once again youre caught between a rock and a crazy place,oh i hate when that happens
oh yeah thats gone its a rough month when halloween and pms hit at the same time,leonard doesnt have time to chat he has to get the mail
are you okay,oh im fine why did you come
so youre going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff,thats a good point my time is much too valuable you know perhaps i should find someone to do it for me you know someone with a rudimentary understanding of science but whose real talents lie in menial labour
so my kid said the funniest thing today,nope
okay im not talking about this with you,oh penny this is a natural human process and were talking about statistically significant savings now if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle are you fairly regular okay no warehouse store but were still on for putput golf right

here you want my peas,peas perfect they can be electrons
sheldon why is this letter in the trash,well theres always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but occams razor would suggest that someone threw it out

were gonna write an application,the prairie sky is wide and high deep in the heart
this is fun huh we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch have a hot dog watch the game,whoa nobody said anything about watching the game
getting kind of grim,then ill look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner that mines my poor bones
no you already threw up once go put on your pjs and brush your teeth,okay but just dont fight
excuse me is there anything youd like to apologise for,yes im sorry i tried to blow up your head it was uncalled for

well that does sound much simpler how long is this going to take,assuming i can keep up this pace three hours 11 minutes and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation
im heckling you its a beloved part of baseball,hes right and given that youre probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade im sure you do suck
sheldon are you sure you want to be bringing raj on your date night with amy,oh absolutely i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation and casual physical contact but nowhere is it specified that i cant outsource that to an indian
cool i think i just learned something,did you have fun doing it
interesting can you see how a grown man an accomplished scientist who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources,no
oh for gods sake just come to the play,all right i dont want to but at least that makes sense
hey,hello
oh youre so arrogant if you were a superhero your name would be captain arrogant and you know what your superpower would be arrogance,youre wrong again if my superpower were arrogance my name would be dr arroganto

thats very sweet but we were thinking more of us maybe living together with not you,i dont understand how could we all live together if im not there
how about we just have a little quiet time now,all right hmm huh im sorry im finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the checkengine light to be very troubling

um let me just have some coffee first and then ill have the strength to tell you how much i wont be doing that hello,hello leonard
please let me be there when you tell her that,why so you can see the look on amys face when she hears my topnotch idea
exactly how does that make you feel,the same way any normal person would i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldonface confetti
did you make it clear that its two different train cars turned into hot dog stands,abundantly
sorry,sorry wonât bring their kites down ow string burn string burn

thank you,i believe it was your turn in the game
sheldon what is it,leonards asleep
thank you thats very comforting,thats not the comforting part
so hows amy,amys changed i might have to let her go
oh come on i dont want to sit by myself,thats what typhoid mary said and clearly her friends buckled
you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords,i didnt try i succeeded for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to debus
im a what,im not sure it could go either way
you know im sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back,i dont want my job back ive spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations before that i spent four years working on my thesis before that i was in college and before that i was in the fifth grade this is my first day off in decades and im going to savour it
okay sheldon i understand that youre going through a bit of a career crisis youre searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully,alright
hello hey howard whats wrong okay okay well be right there,what happened
well as long as were suspending the parameters i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover,thats a big step
oh i say a lot of things sweetie so how about it sheldon,i dont know if youre my xmen what are your powers
yeah well ive been dreaming about spending valentines day with a girl since i was six,shame on you thats no dream for a scientist

okay so whats up,well uh penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by dr emile farminfarmian
okay question 1 rank the following aspects of sheldon cooper in order of appeal intelligence ruthless attention to hygiene playfulness java applet writing,i know i may have started off with a fairly obvious one you did an aspect of my most appealing trait playfulness why dont you just go ahead and write that number 1 im afraid youre on your own for the rest it should take you no more than 3 hours
im sure itll wash off,little comfort tonight i look like a hells angel
if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath,im not hitting on her
sheldon i told you no klingon,fine ill do it in english but it loses something the need to find another human being to share ones life with has always puzzled me maybe because im so interesting all by myself with that being said may you find as much happiness with each other as i find on my own the klingon would have made you cry
sweet,why are you waving a white flag
aw sweetie im comfortable around you too,of course you are im warm and soothing im like a human bowl of tomato soup

yup theres no inflammation at all sheldon,then it must be a tumour
if you want i can yell at you later,it wont be as good
fine whatever priya will be having breakfast,all right so technically its not a dinner date i suppose you could call it a uh dinfast date but if you did youd open yourself to peerbased mocking such as hey leonard how was your dinfast with priya last night
jews dont have heaven,then to avoid jewish hell
so pennys a little messy,a little messy the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid im just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee tables having a tiny garage sale
you think,granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of pennys quality of life
it only gets funnier when you explain it sheldon,i know
its calmed the pants off me a couple of times,sold
or a korean family in alhambra,but theyll know im not you should i call myself professor proton jr
what do you mean hes getting deported,i believe it means that the u s government is going to expel him from the country he could then either return to his native india emigrate to another country thats willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate personally id choose pirate

okay just one question what,my point is pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism ive used many times i did it the first time i went to see you in a play you had no idea commander umfrumf of ceti alpha three was in the audience oh dont worry he gave you seven thumbs up
sheldon penny was our only hope,im sorry leonard but revenge is a dish best served cold
thats not true,that sounds like us i still dont understand why youre upset you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps
before we do i just talked to leonard and if youre gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard then im out but if youre interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher then im willing to give this a sht,i suppose thats a fair request theres no reason we both cant benefit from this experience
fair enough but in its essence teaching is a performance art in the classroom paradigm the teacher has the responsibility to communicate as well as entertain and engage,i sense that youre trying to slowwalk me to an epiphany would you mind very much jumping to it
you betrayed us for money who are you,im a rogue knight elf dont you people read character descriptions wait wait wait somebody just clicked buy it now
come on sheldon you cant move dont you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns,oh if that were only true unfortunately as im earthbound for the foreseeable future i need to find a location thats more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena like enid oklahoma low crime rate and highspeed internet connectivity but no model train shops sorry enid

you guys missed a pretty great time,the conductor and i have the same pocket watch

if you dont do this i wont take you to the comic book store,hello nice work with the laser by the way looking out at your fresh young faces i remember when i too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student of course i was 14 and id already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to despite my 9 oclock bedtime now there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics although its more likely that youll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava
yeah itll help them get away when they see a ggghost,are they making fun of us
no yeah,so what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition
no you dont understand during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide yeah okay its a shelf,now i notice youre using titanium did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes theyre lighter cheaper and half twice the tensile strength

stay down bitch yeah ha ha natural selection at work,i weep for humanity
sheldon sheldon are you okay,dont trample me
i showed him some card tricks,oh

a good question howard turns out you cant according to the document you drew up sheldon the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60day comment period were those criteria met,no
why,howard is a complete and total ass bernadette is in pennys bed amy bites and penny may or may not have coitus with leonard
thats right,you know what im going to do i am going to sit here and just let them stew
really levar burtons coming here,possibly i tweeted him
just personal reasons,my spideysense tells me this has something to do with penny
thanks,so whats got you up did you have a bad clam
how many,who cares he stole the idea and doesnt deserve his own joke
okay well im gonna have to call them and cancel the order,excuse me but was this not your goal financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation my brilliance and innovation of course but still
fine then well just stay here and do it,well you didnt suggest a beach house
agreed and well use mellifluous tomorrow,well i have to void my bladder it was nice spending this time with you
are you sure you want to do this,the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look
well,oh im sorry condescending means
you said it,theres no denying i have feelings for you that cant be explained in any other way i briefly considered that i had a brain parasite but that seems even more farfetched the only conclusion was love i know whats happening this is a panic attack soccermom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated
i looked her in the eye smiled and said im happy for you because thats what friends do,they lie so they dont look petty
im coming,hey there he is theres my old buddybudbud
all right let me rephrase the question why are you wearing long underwear,youre kidding shouldnt the question be why arent you
whats up,well as you may know ive been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels and i thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk
uh sorry guys that girl is freaky,come again
with lime jello,i need a growth medium and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt here swab my throat
thank you officer,its all gone all gone
you okay,if i was okay i wouldve said hello and not the much more ominous hello
look i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness if i get the chance to do this there is nothing you can say thats going to stop me,very well things between you and penny have never been better i hope four months apart doesnt change anything i should have opened with that huh
how did you even get in you weirdo,yeah really ive seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years but when i do it its weird
i guess this could count as an adventure,it was and even though were not allowed back there they can never take today away from us unlike my sense of smell which hasnt returned since the tasing no i got nothing
oh i dont know maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven the higgs field just got proven and youve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and youre no closer to proving it than when you started,yeah well ive had a lot on my plate we happen to live in a golden age of television
and begin this is kind of creepy,were not supposed to talk during this part
so i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummys tomb or they also have the tardis from doctor who,a tardis makes no sense its a time machine from a sciencefiction show it has nothing to do with halloween that being said if you dont get a tardis you stink and your party stinks
no you said would it help if i said im sorry,and you never answered me so who owes whom an apology now
sheldon,im sorry leonard this is toby loobenfeld hes a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minored in theatre at mit
sheldon open the door,i cant im naked
sheldon go to bed you have work in the morning,maybe maybe not maybe tomorrow i start a bongo band and tour the world
yeah i got it sheldon why,well you see while leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us
forget about the bobcat,how can i you wont stop talking about it
yes,if i were to give you this gift basket based on that action alone and no other data infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us
all im saying is we live in a world where closure isnt always an op,tion okay for the sake of argument lets say i have a problem what would be your plan for addressing it
i told you theres nothing to worry about,well ive been doing some research and ive learned that one in 700 000 people die from general anaesthesia
if you people think this is better than tom hanksgiving youre all crazy,two one six four two zero one nine eight nine and that little lady is pi to a thousand places
oh i think i see our next stop,you cant be serious if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense id follow leonard on instagram

whats up my nerdizzles raj sheldon i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette,hello
by making constipated moose sounds,when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male you see when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love
shes just excited about the holidays,yes and shes not taking my feelings into account at all maybe its time i teach her a lesson
ununravelable,yes if she googles leopold houston shell find a facebook page an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony com

oh this heat is brutal,as someone from the tropical subcontinent of india you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature
oh the horror,indeed yeah at one point raj put on reggae music and his sister took off her shoes it was like the last days of caligula oh i have to get this umbrella
sheldon dont defecate where you eat means dont have a romantic relationship in the workplace,really
so listen there was something i was hoping to float past you,mm
thats not what i meant,well if you were referring to her illness your question should have been what ails her

im happy for you sheldon but i have to admit im going to miss sharing an office with you,oh of course you are feel free to drop by any time
so what happens when it counts down,unless leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds this computer will send an email to your parents in india saying that youre in a secret relationship with the whiterthanmarshmallowfluff leonard hofstadter
no sorry,want me to show my work
to pay my cable bill,all right pencils down i have lokh makh and cherrrkh anybody got those
sheldon i dont care if you want to be friends with penny,oh well so the emotional turmoil thats been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified
they developed the relationship closeness inventory which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour,yeah not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory thats pure cooper

yeah ill just tell her you said hey,okay well it was pleasant seeing you other than that business with my testicles
ooh were honey now are we,yes since their relationship became carnal penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie usually in an attempt to soften a thinlyveiled insult
there was no question i simply said hoo,all right i think i have enough to go on possible explanations for your symptoms are in descending order of likelihood hyperthyroidism premature menopause hosting an alien parasite or and i only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases sexual arousal
come on sheldon you have to get her something,why should i she knows that i dont like christmas and yet every year she forces me to celebrate it not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will at the christmas tree lot there was mistletoe and she kissed me under it in public like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show

all that story does is make me feel bad for your mother,leonard youre my best friend why dont you ever take my side
i dont want to play a game sheldon,its called scientists now i will name three scientists then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields to make this game even more compelling you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field not the validity of the field itself for example abu musa jabir ibn hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology okay ready to have some fun

because when he wasnt happy we wanted to kll him there was even a plan we were going to throw his kindle outside and when he went to get it lock the door and let him freeze to death,that seems like a bit of an overreaction

youre boring people sweetie,although sometimes she omits the veil entirely
uh im sorry can we just pause for a minute,whats wrong
can you say that and not make it sound like im a cat who learned how to use the toilet,no the two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable though if pressed id have to give a slight edge to the cat ill save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer i agree to be part of your project congratulations
too bad,youre going up euclid avenue

look how sweet he is come over and say hi come on you can do it dont be scared come on oh just pet the bird you big baby,i did it i actually did it okay now flush him
you could have a long island iced tea,will that calm my nerves
sheldon what are you doing here,hang on 130 over 80 a little high we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk
so did you at least get sheldons fake stuff back,no we failed in our noble quest
what if i brought food to your place,that would be acceptable on mondays i eat thai food mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from siam palace
oh im not confused at all youre like a sexy toddler,i dont know how to process that

okay listen to me playing games is not gonna help get amy back,i am not trying to get her back but out of curiosity what is a way
sounds like a breakthrough should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover,its time travel leonard i will have already done that
okay the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass,the reason i was being a pain in the b is because i was worried about him and no one else was

this is an easy one you love this guy,me
santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough,theres an argument for that but i want to make sure
so this is accurate,its been around for 25 years and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers

basketball pope,and thats how its done

sheldon in a couple hours i have to get up pee and then wander around the house,well then ill make this quick um i want to talk about the paper you sent leonard now i know he said its promising and hes going to collaborate on it but now that you and i are friends again i am at your disposal and um frankly lending my name and reputation to it will help because a lot of people think that youre a washedup hasbeen or dead
yeah he does but he got caught up in a computer game and,hit troll with axe hit troll with axe hit troll with axe oh my this is one tough troll
i had a feeling wed have a talk like this sooner or later are you finally getting fuzz in weird places,penny please im on the horns of a relationship dilemma and for the record i had a full pubis of hair by the time i was 19
you two should be ashamed of yourselves using women to advance your cause with sexuality and whatever amy plans on doing,are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit

huh well i think theres some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter,thats helpful okay of these four areas
shes not catwoman shes just a generic cat,and thats the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition
what was it called i hate my son and thats why he cant have cake,it was obviously effective leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist perhaps if shed also denied him christmas hed be a little better at it
youre right it does and its something that im struggling with these days,then why are you doing it
i understand your reticence dr cooper and i sympathize but the hard facts are occasionally we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research,i dont care its demeaning and i refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the texas state fair which by the way is something you dont want to attend wearing a star trek ensigns uniform
id love to im just about to do yoga with penny,leonard im at the police station i was robbed they took my phone my wallet my ipad everything

how is that not a braniac,well for one thing she was french for another it was literature
right now howards staring down at our planet like a tiny jewish greek god zeusowitz,i must admit i cant help but feel a twinge of envy he can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes his dim uncomprehending eyes its like a cat in an airport carrying case
sheldon youre a remarkable scientist just be patient im sure youll find the breakthrough youve been looking for,thank you
sheldon that wasnt for you,oh no im not going to drink it i just wanted to hear the pop yeah i knew it was coming still scary
just tell her,i called leonard because i failed and i didnt want you to think less of me
fine i accept your premise now please lets go,i am not leaving until im done
i wasnt going to get alcohol gosh i wonder what leonards doing right now i miss him so much,well if youd like we could call him i mean that you could call him as ive explained the absence of my friends does not cause me pain as rock and roll bad boy paul simon once said i am a rock i am an iiiisland
no one wants to hear it,why die why did he die old told i was told he was old
you said i could buy a desk,this isnt a desk this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity
yeah i am pulling out all the stops theres a 39 95 lovers special at p f changs egg rolls dumplings bottomless wok and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front,given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded wouldnt a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking ones steady gal to witness a brutal mrder
does it matter,no as long as it bobbles
into the bag,they took my battle ostrich
that just cant be right,youre questioning my math
oh oh no no its because i spent all afternoon at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held according to father solakian no one attended luckily my trip wasnt a complete waste i lit a candle and prayed for your death but im not armenian so it probably wont work this is over right,oh not necessarily i suggest you look for longlost relatives either in armenia or lebanon
it says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met were you unable to consummate the marriage,hah penny next
next message,are you mad at me oh no youre mad at me im so sorry beep bop boop bop

i grew up in a house full of crazy academics instead of leaving santa milk and cookies we had to leave him a research paper and in the morning you could tell hed been there because the paper would be graded,no wonder you love christmas that sounds amazing
sounds like you hit the ground running i have a bit of good news myself my most recent paper on how a cooperative longterm potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of neuron,ooh speaking of good news somebody just hit 100 twitter followers

i dont know the man on the box looks so happy,penny if im going to buy leonard a gift im going to do it right i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did
then i think its a terrific idea,great wait till you hear about our van
ooh what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up,nice you mean like at parks and schools
oh how kind of her,agreed most primates donât show that sort of discretion a female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do
i thought amy was gonna drive you home,yeah i thought so too but shes acting very strangely i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brotherinlaws witch doctor practice
all right sheldon here we go kleingasts field guide to north american insects hey toby right here see it the common field cricket aka gryllus assimilis which is latin for suck it you lose,hang on voilà the snowy tree cricket aka oecanthus fultoni which is latin for ill suck nothing of course im joking because the latin for that is nihil exsorbibo

yeah and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts you know i gotta ask why didnt you just get a license at 16 like everybody else,i was otherwise engaged
no that was completely called for we need quiet,so your project is more important than mine
well whats your plan,all right my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurses office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed
yes before all things im a scientist im just there to do my work and with a little luck scare the living crap out of some monkeys,hmm you sure your mothlike personality wont be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself
be careful,if i were not being careful your telling me to be careful would not make me careful
and im a little busy right now,but i came to file a complaint somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature
so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation but over here you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients,good one boss

well mrs latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump,oh wow
of course,now before i start i need you to know that im very excited about this and anything you say that isnt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question so keep an open mind
no,penny penny penny
this is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym,plus theres almost no chance well see any of our coworkers half naked
sheldon ive given you the simplest things to do and you havent done one of them right,maybe thats because im not being challenged its the same reason einstein failed math
you want to fire me,what i want is irrelevant this is pennys decision penny
how could he ruin the game,given the cards that have already been played penny can only be holding necromancer potions which are only effective against wraiths and daywalkers and there are no more of either left to be drawn the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire wapon a troll two ogres and the jewel of osiris
sheldon youve never worked in a lab like this before you have no experience in the field of biology,i have plenty of experience in biology i bought a tamagotchi in 1998 and its still alive lets do this
why would she even do this,shes been conducting an experiment on apes where theyre given various puzzles to solve i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldnt be able to solve them thats when amy said want to make this interesting
yes channel set baguettes 20 points total weight,remarkable diamonds crystallized carbon every day people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire but just because youve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars
i said ill get to it,im sensing awkwardness am i right
hey i am every bit as much of a man as penny now lets do this,wait its not all pants theres one shirt
thank you sheldon,youre welcome now lets get this over with
what did they give you,turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat its the right ingredients but in the wrong order in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash
i will put up my fantastic four number 48 first appearance of silver surfer against your flash 123 the classic flash of two worlds issue,all right you have a wager

you got yourself a sleepover,do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas
please dont do that,all right but im given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone its more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat
i i dont,think woman who blew their nose and when
sheldon this is not your home,this is not anyones home this is a swirling vortex of entropy
its never safe,yeah well i know that now
did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction,no

thanks for being with us today dr cooper,my pleasure ira
say betsy ross what you working on,i have no idea because the story of me sewing the first american flag is unsupported poppycock

i just want to say one more thing about this just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that were a bad couple,the answer is one simple test away hmm you know its like when i thought there was a possum in my closet did i sit around wondering no i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag
look your anxiety levels are right in the zone,really oh thats fantastic now wait theyre dropping why are they dropping
hey stuart come on in,what are you doing here

i might kll him right now,the dark knight has your back hes scared but he has your back
sheldon im not a whiner,its amusing that he doesnt hear it
i dont care i dont have to do anything you say because i dont think i want to live here anymore,where are you going
they texted me,well as i predicted i am sick my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate
well honey not to complain but we were starting to think you didnt either,is that really necessary good lord the interference pattern in the fracture the motion of the wave through the molecular structure ive been looking at it all wrong i cant consider the electrons as particles they move through the graphene as a wave its a wave the moment to applaud would be now troglodytes
hang on sheldon do you have any emotional attachment to this box,no its a novelty i ordered off the internet now did you hear the click
not right now sheldon,but i think it would be comforting
dinners ready,what are we having
yeah because i have something weird to tell her,oh i thought it was a game
my physics bowl trophy leonard is so smart sheldon who,alright that is very immature
dr cooper,yes
what are you waiting for hit send,i cant losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest
shting at a target,with what
that was kind of icy you two okay,oh were fine as howard advised shes merely respecting our professional boundaries
not right now sheldon,but i think it would be comforting
for you or with you,in this context for me could mean with me
what,it appears to be a lord of the rings ring
this says you can make end of life decisions for me,as your friend lets hope it doesnt come to that please sign
you want an acting lesson,perhaps two id like to master the craft
so listen there was something i was hoping to float past you,mm

it wasnt so are you in,certainly
oh thats a big deal,i know when will this nightmare end
okay here it is i have this great moneymaking idea i just need a gear head to get it to the finish line,technically howards the gear head leonards just a dime store laser jockey
it sounds like either way i finally get some rest,i have to be honest with you leonard im truly worried
i dont care get the tardis,yes this party just became a major rager
its not funny,no oh it actually is if you get the joke its based on the premise that princeton isnt a very good school
im on it hi mrs wolowitz is is howard there okay thanks that particular dog of wr will have to call you back after his bath,see if raj is done with pilates
okay,now where was i lets see oh yes over here you what are you doing now
youre not helping,alright what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion
dr cooper dr cooper,is someone there
yeah im excited to finally meet your girlfriend,speaking of which according to a recent study out of oxford university when someone takes on a new romantic partner that person loses one or two close friends
well,i believe i can answer that
oh sonofabitch,i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag but returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you
when i broke my arm i used to stick a coat hanger down there you ever try that maybe go in through the ear,you wouldnt make jokes if you could feel the way i feel
no i just got a text from stuart brent spiner is at the party,brent spiner
why dont you just do the test,in the interest of science id be willing to
sheldon you are a smart guy you must know,smart id have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as smart
what,this is banana bread
that right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit,so can you get it working
oh you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time,yeah we have to be somewhere

i dont know,you know the holidays are just around the corner maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there
there are no solar flares right now,yes there are
you okay,am i okay leonard iâm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a nobel prize and cities named after me all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction and my bowel movements run like a german train schedule am i okay
get that guy get that guy pew pew pew pew,dr rostenkowski it may interest you to know that saying pew pew pew isnt as effective as pressing your blaster key in the same way that saying whee doesnt make the land speeder go
they call themselves bozites,they should its one of the first things i plan to bring up upon arrival
well good for you buddy well let you get back in there,oh no no im not going back in there that baby is so irritating he has literally been crying his entire life
oh,based on the number of awkward encounters ive had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning plus the number of times shes returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before
so what do you need the headphones for,well ive been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesnt make protons decay im hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment see ive got uh my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature uh i have fleecelined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty and then oh last but not least this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade richard feynman
well it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time although truth be told my groins a little worse for wear ow why did you do that,to send a message she is not for you
got it,leonard youll never guess who i just found online hey
sweetheart your little friend is concerned about you,yes well im not a child im a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit and i certainly dont need someone telling on me to my mother
it was a spur of the moment thing i figured it would go for thousands and i just wanted to be a part of it,theres only 30 seconds left in the auction
leonards having astronomically inaccurate star trek sex with my sister,i can see how that would be upsetting come in ill get the sheets and blankets for the couch
hi,oh theres no need to interact with me im just here to observe
stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in,you know those confounded things make me dizzy
oh,2530 east andy devine avenue
i know ive always wanted one,well hes even more cunning than we thought
sounds like most of my dates,oh dear lord get away from me you monster
all right can we please go,one moment according to my drivers ed book a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is drivers door handle is visible in the lower right corner theres the handle oh no too far bringing it back optimized now where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror
train day,the fun starts with brunch at carneys in studio city a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car next stop travel town an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s finally were off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood for dinner at thats right the hollywood carneys a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car
what should we do,were the justice league of america theres only one thing we can do turn around and slowly walk away
when this is done it will be attached to the payload bay and the sensor apparatus will rest on it,uh huh so its a shelf
sheldon what are you doing with maxi pads,i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days
have you not noticed that ive been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours,i just thought you were bad at the game
but it could be part of your problem let me give you an example when i was eight i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project do lima beans grow better to classical music but my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brothers earlier do lima beans grow worse to rock n roll i felt so guilty i gave the ribbon back,and how did that make you feel
okay okay we get it you set the scene,hoo
well seeing as its purpose was to piss you off id say its spoton,all right i see whats going on this is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile titfortat exchanges well titted
okay so youd lose most of jar jar all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings which are like watching cspan with monsters,get rid of the trade route part then how would palpatine get chancellor valorum kicked out of office how would he get himself elected how can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous
ah dr cooper thank goodness i completely forgot your address but then i remembered that id written it on my hand lucky for me i didnt confuse it with what id written on my other hand which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star cause if i tried to go there id be crushed by hypergravity anyway hello,hello
hey have you seen koothrapali,hes not here maybe the avenger summoned him
im sure mrs floridas walking funny can we get back to work,yeah hes right oh heres a thought what if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic
i dont see anything,give it a second to load whenever youre ready att okay here we go this is us here to the south is professor loomis and the geology department according to their twitter feed theyre out of sunblock which means theyll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma thats our edge all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge the rockworshipping pastyfaced bastards wont know what hit them all right lets move out
uh sleep night i mean obviously good night i started to say sleep tight then i changed my mind in the middle i swear to god im smart,get it together man
time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day,you dont tackle the big issues ramona you fence with them en garde riposte
mmhmm,leonard takes los robles avenue
you know if he really wants to stay and finish i can give him a ride home,please leonard he said its okay
i dont think thats going to happen sheldon,no one ever does thats why it happens
what is that,this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard one of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens
what,the ducks in my tub
what up moon pie,nobody calls me moon pie but meemaw
all right,are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis that wasnt a joke
what was that,you said be nice to penny i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice
okay well tell him i loved him on star trek,please leonard stop trying to horn in on my new friends
give me one circumstance in which that would be useful,all right picture this a beautiful outdoor concert now as a human i appreciate beethoven as a fungus i have a terrific view growing out of a towering maple tree and no thank you expensive concessions because as an algae ill just snack on this sunlight
no i i i was thinking if it isnt too much trouble id like to get your opinion about my my paper,thank you it would be an honour
hey howie says youve been making fun of him all day now both of you apologize right now,shes so tiny its funny when shes mad
yes well that is a good question but is this really the best way to figure it out,yeah i agree the social sciences are largely hokum but short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship this is the best i can do
well thats every song i know whats up,youre good friends with penny right
what,well think about it its a product that doesnt spoil and youre going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years
of course you dont mr cooper let me just ask you a question what was your last job,senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech focusing on m theory or in laymans terms string theory
still right behind you,copy that red five radio contact is sufficient no need to extend your middle finger
oh you admit that its our work,no once again im throwing you a bone and once again you are welcome
by the power vested in us by the state of california,and the klingon high council
has your uh assistant said anything about me,oh in fact she has uh her exact words were what is that guys problem
sheldon,yeah
you know if youre trying to make space on the dvr why dont you just get rid of some of the stuff youve already watched like um alphas,no thats the season two finale that was quite the cliffhanger im going to rewatch it before season three starts
i have 26 hundred comic books in there i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells,challenge accepted were locked out
darn tootin i do if the court will excuse my homespun cornfed nebraskan turn of phrase,excellent go on
what about me,well i understand there are several types of artificial women maybe you should look into that
why because i got an ugly itchy sweater and my brother got a car no i was her favorite,i seem to be a few tickets short are there more in the box
theres no guawantee weve gotta go against each other in the wound wobin so lets thwow down you know unless youre afwaid,we accept your challenge name a time and place
would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up,it would but you know how much i admire preparedness how did you know wed be in the living room
oh you are going down cooper,i dont think so kripke ive bounced many a rubber ball in my day
i said get out,okay ill give it a sht
well wow thats incredible,excuse me thirty what under thirty what to watch what
guys what are we doing we sent the girls away so we could focus,i dont think it worked
well you know how youre always saying that amy is a girl whos your friend and not your girlfriend,uhhuh
is there some kind of new coping mechanism youre employing,the more interesting question you should be asking is what does this flower smell like
i have two words for you the first is big the others whoop,it is a big whoop it made almost all the work youve done since youve been here completely useless
now youre helping them find ways to make us miserable,well im sorry leonard im a problemsolver its what i do
oh too bad ive always wanted to go to long beach,its a very nice community the queen mary is docked there once the largest ocean liner in the world its now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping mrder mystery dinner
im sorry but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night,there you go perfect
sheldon weve been on this train 90 seconds and youve already said a thousand words just tell us where to sit and shut up,here im hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clicketyclack of steel wheels on polished rails your sour disposition will abate
what do you want,amy this isnt easy to say all relationships are difficult but even more so when youre in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions and frankly who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo
next game lets switch helmets,no id look silly in that helmet
okay sheldon i think youve made your point,so we multiply 193 minus 21 men before the loss of virginity so 172 times 0 18 gives us 30 96 sexual partners lets round that up to 31
yeah once he figures out how to work a door,i was not panicked and i am not overly attached to leonard
oh no,oh no
so you decided to get the whole manhattan project,yes this is enrico fermi richard feynman edward teller otto frisch and zazzles
thank you,for the record i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto
youve also got something from the pasadena municipal court,undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order from left to right its supposed to be federal state and then city of pasadena
what,amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me im obligated to do something nice for you so yes ill go to your dopey play
my point is if i were a horse or a bird id be very nervous around james cameron,it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about for example why wasnt william shatner in the new star trek movie
anyway after we get done snowboarding i go back to the lodge and get in the jacuzzi theres no one around so naturally im freeballing it next thing i know this beautiful chick shows up drunk out of her skull wants to get in with me,question was it a jacuzzi or a hot tub
to friendship,would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking and the answer was elephant
yeah hes kind of an ass,thank you may i share something with you thats troubling me
hows that going,you tell me i feel like i cant breathe and i am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs
probably im just enjoying the foreplay does this mean you are done mocking my acting career,oh im sorry i thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that ones career had reached the end of the road
what what what what,leonard and penny
are you set on people laughing with you cause if youre cool with at you,i dont get it
so,yes general tso
oh sheldon am i glad youre back taking a turn for the worst i think im going to need another bath,im surprised to hear that see the other day i was concerned that you werent recovering so while you were sleeping i took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab
nothing the engine does that sometimes,that cant be nothing the check engine light is on we need to find a service station
im gonna go with sad so whats the story with you and this dvd,theres nothing to tell maybe i purchased a book entitled dont sweat the small stuff and i followed its wise suggestions one of which was stop and smell the flowers
okay sheldon i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago and i know we rented it on your card but its been like seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened so ininininstead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are what if this one time you just tried staying calm,that seems like a reasonable request although so did hey leonard would you mind returning that dvd
sheldon thats incredible,yeah i know they called it the greatest thing since the communist party although im pretty sure that the communist party made them say that i like china see they know how to keep people in line
um well im from nebraska so what can you tell me about the state flag,gosh penny whatd you have for breakfast a big glass of good question juice the nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue spread your legs invite them in
no,fine bad
from a neurobiological standpoint leonard you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromonebased stink of desperation,did you know that leonard
what,nothing i said nothing
cmon raj how am i supposed to know who shes attracted to or was attracted to or who she might be attracted to in the future,and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation because i too know absolutely nothing about priyas preferences in male companionship and with that i will rezip my lip
mrs cooper hey its penny yeah i think i broke your son hey hold on talk to your mother,mommy i love you dont let spock take me to the future
anyway thanks again cooper suck eggs,since when do you help out barry kripke
we agweed to exchange copies of our work let me see yours,why dont you show me yours first
mmm gentlemen i put it to you the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour,first off that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate secondly the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death it is extracted from the plant
a what,a naked man sat on it now heres my concern his diet is rich in fatty deli meats what test do you have to detect lipid residue
you ever going to sleep with amy,thats awfully personal
well i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things theyd never say to your face,interesting i cant think of a single thing i wouldnt say to someones face
uh im just gonna be honest with the guy,honesty will never get us in
yeah more cutbacks,unacceptable it baffles me why they dont simply let some of you go so that theres money available for my research
really would it be totally weird if i used it,yes
when i was a very young girl when i was 16 years old i made the discovery love all at once and much much too completely it was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow thats how it struck the world for me but i was unlucky deluded,shes remarkable
that long huh,60 only takes me to here i need to get to here
she didnt dump me we were just in different places in the relationship,i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location
glad i could help,its appreciated and if you ever manage to find a woman again ill be glad to return the favour
ive been up all night i had a fight with bernadette,why
you might not want to do that,i assure you i do
thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields,if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that
no youre not sanding penny,are you saying that im forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better
yeah whatever just go buy a sweater,you know the nice thing about shelmart is i own it so i get a 15 discount
forget it,so you can experiment on all the apes you want but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings suddenly im the monster
that was a good one,it was so good
you got one for good luck ill get it,one for good luck must be the kind of math they do at princeton
if youd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place youd be happy all the time,uh penny i i have a couple of questions about your closet is there any reason youre keeping this dead goldfish
no sheldon,then buckle up youre in for a cranky night
come in hurry,penny
hey buddy,hello
sheldon i want you to take that cap off,that nagging tone is helping my anxiety yeah but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill thatd really put the zipadee in my doodah
im calling him,oh goodie put him on speaker phone
oh sweetie it was the best speech i,dont worry everyone in here is safe
yeahyeah which way,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if youre going as far as portland
i guess i could serve both,you guess you dont seem to have much of a handle on this
excuse us for a second sheldon its okay he can do it hes a barber,hes not a barber hes the nephew hes an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry besides mr donofrio knows exactly how i like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in texas
well its always me take one for the team,i have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will and then you came along and reshaped him with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals
yeah okay cool i dont need the pbs special i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job you know like bernadette does,why cant leonard teach you
more juvenile than this,ill get the blankets you google how to have childlike fun
actually i wouldnt mind going out for a bite sheldon,wont that spoil our appetites for the chicken youre going to make me
okay partner lets do it,come on click the mouse with me
mmmmmm,okay everybody calm down there is a simple solution here raj take me to the train store and then i dont care what you people do
whats wrong with christmas,oh where to begin trees indoors overuse of the words tis and twas and the absurd custom of one stocking everyone knows socks belong in pairs who uses one sock
theres a 200watt uninterruptible backup power supply,what if someone steals my keys
you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas,youre right judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did
you really think hes gonna send us to a bowling alley,well if he does do you know how filthy those rental balls are they might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams
so are you guys coming to my new years eve costume party,of course were coming as the justice league of america
no,dont waste my time
what are you doing,oh good morning shoemaker i think youll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night
that is no way to speak to your mother,perhaps not but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the bible to me my whole life and then desecrates one of ethan allens finest sofas
oh we were just talking about how much we love working with you isnt that right dan,over the years here at fun with flags weve had an opportunity to learn laugh wonder
no just keep walking,he must be very kll at coitus
look sheldon all iâm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to amy,strap on a pair of what skates
does she work in a similar field to you,ha the opposite shes a neurobiologist and im a theoretical physicist my spirit guides can go suck an egg
not really,oh well
the application in your hand give it to her,oh
yeah if you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country do you know what they would have said,that i couldnt do it
now the first thing you have to know about shelly is ever since he was a little boy he was always concerned with the wellbeing of others and he didnt think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity so he was gonna power the entire town for free,tell her about the uranium tell her about the uranium
i dont know just think about something else,can i think about the spiny anteater
we did but there were extenuating circumstances,i see did her abysmal housekeeping kll finally trump her perkiness
again right now its just a dummy procedure but eventually it will drop us into,i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership
monkeys,when does a monkey have a trunk
and go where,it doesnt matter
oh sorry i dont know your sad song,i dont have a sad song im not a child
sheldon we have to call it off,we dont have that option weve accepted the challenge we cant run away from a fight
yes,okay that was tricky cause when it comes to alcohol she generally means business
i have to get a lock for my door,i think youll like the drill tonight ive tried to make it fun each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by canada pick a catastrophe any catastrophe
well thats too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct,thats your opinion
whats a dogapus,a hybrid dog and octopus mans underwater best friend
from what i saw the other day i could understand why he and some people might find you,what
so do we and ive seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things,its called parallel play
oh dear lord,no dont look to him hes mad at you right now
so you see what im getting at,squeaky wheel gets the grease
not unless she destroys tokyo,rats
you promised penny what,that i wouldnt tell you the secret shhhhh
a floppy disk,well i started the list when i was nine
maybe he found you um a bit much,thats kind of a stretch look when it comes to social kll ive mastered the big three theres the coy smile theres the friendly chuckle theres the vocalization of sympathy aw that last ones tricky im still working on it
of course i understand sheldon theres something else ive been wanting to say but before i do i just i want you to know that you dont have to say it back i know youre not ready and i dont want you to say it just because social convention dictates,i love you too
ive got a solution,great what is it
are you really gonna sit here all day,think of me as arthur dent in hitchhikers guide to the galaxy lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home
i could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next star trek movie,oh that seems overly harsh i mean you gave in to a human weakness you didnt kll a man you know its a tad oldschool but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey
section 5,feel free to retain a lawyer
what did you do put this in your tea,oh dear now im not even smarter than you
yes,nice try now element lads ability is the power to transmute chemical elements helium has an atomic number of two if you multiply that by the atomic number of n nitrogen you get 14 which is the atomic number of im just funnin you silicon and that is the most common element in the earths surface so that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab
oh thats me,did you let wil wheaton get in your head
what,its a time of day i invented it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening preevning im fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need
well so do i but theyll never let us,is that the attitude that helped you get penny
i just want to say one more thing about this just because penny and i are very different people does not mean that were a bad couple,the answer is one simple test away hmm you know its like when i thought there was a possum in my closet did i sit around wondering no i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag
juggle,you health nuts kll me
im not going to do that sheldon,leonard the people at nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience we have to do our part too that was uncalled for but ill play along ow i had an unusual experience with amy last night
i know what the anthropic principle is,of course i just explained it to you now where do you stand on it
yes sir,you can count on us were on it what the hell do you mean dead end
ugh ugh ugh ugh,penny
whos mohammed lee,mohammed is the most common first name in the world lee the most common surname as i didnt know the answer i thought that gave me a mathematical edge
and that is your opinion,i forgive you lets go home
leave,what is your problem
night attaboy hofstadter nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies hey im back,cut take 47
were gonna set a date,okay if you say so
oh im just doing this awful workout i hate it,well if you hate it then why are you doing it although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard
get out,fine ive hesitated to point this out but i must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit im just trying to clean up after your mess well talk in the morning
how come you didnt go into work today,im taking a sabbatical because i wont kowtow to mediocre minds
all right yeah ill play along what was my first strike,march 18th you violated my rule about forwarding email humour
big or small i dont like rabbits they always look like theyre about to say something but they never do,rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size and on a side note they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis
yeah well before they went out of business i bought 4 000 containers i keep them in the trunk of my car,but oh this changes everything
really why,my queen can now take your rook from below
blue and yellow make green,well then its settled
what sheldon tell me whats going on,i saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again
oh god,you met her at pasadenas most popular irish watering hole lucky baldwins where maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams
yes i am,penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building
okay feel better bye she doesnt want to talk,not surprising pennys emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless or maybe she just doesnt want to talk
what difference does it make,the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a nonverbal signal to verify the identity of ones coconspirators
i asked,what did they say
well not to steal from the bible but turning water into wine sounds pretty good,i dont think youre taking this seriously
oh i have to go to the bathroom so bad,every year i told you wear a diaper
give it a chance sheldon you might actually like it,youre absolutely right nope
maybe i could do it,you really you can assess the quality of my work okay um here i wrote this when i was five years old
oh that is not true,ive got to go with leonard on this he is wrong more than anyone i know
before you get upset i believe ive come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy,people usually start a meeting with a joke but you go ahead end with one
okay simulated zerogravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three two one,fascinating
why would it trouble you its like your third favourite cartoon theme song,it is right behind dododododo inspector gadget and teenage mutant ninja turtles heroes in a halfshell
thats nice,oh thats a rather earthy cologne my uncle used to wear that perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before leonard returns
i dont know maybe,i want you to know that im genuinely concerned about your wellbeing
whats your point,call me a romantic i like to think that your mark ruffalo is still out there somewhere
sheldon im working i cant take you to the dentist also and i cant stress this enough i dont want to take you to the dentist,cant help a friend out in a time of need huh i see where your therapist was coming from
okay when you say seeing penny what exactly does that mean,we had dinner last night she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it well little hot dog i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog a real big dog a hell hound tangential to the primary story how about i circle back to it
why did howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway,we had a difference of opinion
sheldon how is that a fight pose,mr datas wapon is his mind im wielding it
since when do you read social science,i go to the bathroom like everybody else
hey,okay now that everyones here we can begin
mr kim was not only the valedictorian at stamford university he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious stephenson award,youngest till the cyborgs rise up
well i just i thought,if i can interject here obviously leonard is concerned that his mother wont approve of you as his mate
you know sheldon i used to cut my brothers hair i could do it for you,penny i know you mean well offering the kll of the hill folk but um here in town we dont churn our own butter we dont uh make dresses out of gn sacks and uh we sure as sht dont get our hair cut by bottleblonde
smores huh good for you,yes or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement
should i say something i feel like i should say something,you no youll only make it worse
hey youre in a good mood,im in a great mood
thank you sheldon youre a good friend,and youre certainly not going to win a nobel prize
sounds great,excellent choice
hey i dont want you to go any more,why not
im missing something did you say something to penny about alex,oh yes yeah and a fat lot of good it did me all she did was get mad at you
youre welcome,what took you so long
why dont you and your friends come to comiccon with me,really
sheldon this isnt that hard,i may have a better way that you can teach me
thank you how about a hug,how about a hearty handshake
problem,yes he wont let go of my comic book
yes its my water,well thats it then im dead
what,statistically red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour i dont want any hassles with the fuzz
i dunno i just think itâs a waste relax iâm just looking at the box,perhaps you should look with your eyes and not your muscular nebraska manhands
thats right sheldon embrace the dark side,thats not even from your franchise
sheldon,zone
hi,hi
oh my god youre jealous,why would i be jealous
no youre right no theres theres no plots no trucks no feet so what other annoying habits shall we discuss,uh we dont discuss anything leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement as such he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines
how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale,i was wearing size a million pants
well im done fishing you put those on,what for
lets forget about them and pick ourselves out a nice turtle oh how about this one up on the log,oh i dont know he kind of looks like a jerk how about this one
no i dont want to try it my god you are grown men how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and and now that that,again time machine
you got me while youre there could pick me up a few comics for my nephews birthday,i think you mean comic books comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages
great,good im glad
oh come on a smart guy like you itll be a challenge you can make it like an experiment,interesting i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla i could teach you some rudimentary physics
and the award for best group costume goes to justice league of america number three,thank you thank you so much
are you really admitting defeat,i never admit defeat
nope its pretty exciting,arent you afraid of being blinded
tech support can i help you,yes its a robot uprising call the police
some perfect couple he wont even share his food with her,it has avocado on it shes allergic to avocado are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die
shes just so impossible they keep quitting,so whos watching her now
hey sheldon,hello
yeah meemaw did the nasty,i said stop it
yes well lets talk about it anyway,i dont want to not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitzs culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars
sheldon arent you going to introduce us,no i have people for that now youre up
aw whats wrong with her,well she talks a lot she always wants to hold hands
why dont you just tell people youre a zebra,well why dont you just tell people youre one of the seven dwarves
excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that supermans flight is a feat of strength,are you listening to yourself it is well established that supermans flight is a feat of strength it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings an ability he derives from earths yellow sun
nevertheless we are,in addition i really dont think that leonard wants a
sheldon,lets see whats next oh kissings romantic
thats so cool congratulations i guess that makes you the athlete of the group,well not just him may i remind you that youre talking to the seeker bat chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team
absolutely,if i say yes can we turn off that latin orgy music
yeah thats very comforting,comforting is a part of leadership its not a part i care for but such is my burden
were actually scanning equations and getting good results,oh well then by all means carry on i wouldnt want to impede your progress
were trying to get past a security guard not rescue zelda,i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy but one quest at a time so whats the plan
and,i didnt lets go
yeah um of all the things about this that are sad that might not be number one you okay i know he meant a lot to you,im fine
ah youre going off the grid,exactly
sorry okay who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar,i want oatmeal
you dont need a parking space you dont have a car,you dont need an iron man helmet youre not iron man
so shes expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena when in actuality were pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach,ununravelable
yeah so,thats a lot of money for only one colour
well,im quite familiar with plumbing not to brag but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet
what,its the only explanation i can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt
of course not this is just leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship hes manipulating you like he always does,wait wait now hang on you think he manipulates me
youre not changing how penny laughs,no that would be incongruous i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register
sheldon honey ive told you its a small apartment you only have to knock one time,please please i dont have a lot of time look ramona finally dozed off and i need you to help me get rid of her
i thought you didnât like facebook anymore,donât be silly iâm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact
ive reconsidered your offer to let me work with you,for me
oh just come in,thanks for seeing me on such short notice
oh yeah you know every bartender makes it differently why dont you give it a try,all right to the metric system i cant taste the cherries
agreed it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared,i must say amy pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction
what about you sheldon do you have any plans tonight,sadly yes amys taking me to a memorial service its for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave hell never make his way back to china
my mirth classic,is there a station coming up where i can board your giggling train of thought
oh god were never gonna finish in time who made sheldon the boss anyway,i believe im hearing some negativity on the factory floor
i was just wondering if i could talk to you its about leonard,why me why not koothrappali or wolowitz
how could you have gotten it from me im not sick,youre a carrier all these people here are doomed youre doomed
i dont know ive never reneged on a proffer of sperm before,lets try just walking out
what was your first clue,well it was a number of things first the late hour then your demeanour seems very low energy plus your irritability
you mean like in bed or in the shower,no would you please stop referencing that infernal book for example this morning i was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of amys dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale slightly hunched shoulders oh what has that vixen done to me leonard and how do i make it stop
rats dont make toast and cut off the crust,you saw nothing
what are you doing,i am talking to a man in space if you dont have the then he might as well be at the coffee bean over on lake street
something got you down there sheldon,leonard kicked me out of my own apartment and his app team
we were all thinking it really it was kind of the elephant in the room so,anyway um i realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you only one of which is true and then we dont tell you which one it is you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence
did you know edison didnt actuawy invent the wight bulb,what do you want barry
uh ive got some bad news theres no cell service in here,oh well thats all right there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented
what would i even say,zack im sorry youre stupid have a milk dud
you use it to get your way,i use it to get the right way the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence
i think she meant something a little happier,i suppose we could try to make it a celebration but he died so young
im suggesting there might be something you could do about amys urges,its illegal to spay a human being
i trained ricky how to smoke i can train him to sht a poison dart no jury would convict us cause people love monkeys,i understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild but i really need to talk to smart amy now
if i wanted to know i wouldve opened it years ago the closet looks great lets get out of here,wait can i bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride
good night,leonard theres one more thing under article one section three of our roommate agreement im calling an emergency meeting
yeah well it almost kll me,if it wanted to kll you youd be dead
hi fellas hey can i get a beer wow look at you little leonard hofstadter i hear youre a bigtime scientist now,and theres the first zinger ouch
come on,can i at least kick down the door
no,all right then is it fair to say that youre experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening
okay barry thats enough,no no no thats okay i can fight my own battles isnt that right bawwy
yes sheldon keep watching,you know its a shame all that work shes doing to get sober only to be torn apart and eaten alive
erase all the hard drives scrap the surveillance tapes wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run,why wasnt that plan a
please,you got the wrong mustard
sheldon,cookie
you went to president seiberts house in the middle of the night,he didnt respond to my email his phone number is unlisted tell me what my other option was
youre still on that,in these uncertain times doesnt humanity deserve a gift
i guess it didnt go well,we dont know that not to a certainty all we know is that leonard is home
that doesnt work any more he just thinks im taking him to the doctor so now that youre no longer invested in string theory what are you gonna pursue,oh there are so many exciting areas black holes dark matter
okay let me just get right to it amy is judgmental sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious,so
whered you go,my mother asked me to get some towels i took advantage of the vague request and went to bed bath beyond excuse me im on the phone so rude
sheldon play nice,well its not a great question how could somebody possibly think were going to blow up the moon thats a great question
rough night casey jones,you dont know the half of it it was billed as a lively giveandtake on the merits of model train sizes but it was actually a setup to intimidate weakminded spineless rubes into buying ho starter sets
amy said you were having a rough time and i thought maybe we could talk is that okay,certainly although right now im having a rough time because theres three people in my room and its starting to feel like a discotheque
done,i think the word youre looking for is bravo
so did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you,yes i didnt care for it
okay can someone please tell me whats going on here,whats going on is i was led to believe i was making groundbreaking strides in science when in fact i was being fed false data at the hands of wolowitz koothrappali and your furry little boy toy
i still dont know why you left,i cant tell you
here we go,that is my spot in an everchanging world it is a single point of consistency if my life were expressed as a function on a fourdimensional cartesian coordinate system that spot at the moment i first sat on it would be zerozerozerozero
yeah,i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band of course id be the dreamy one and the smart one
the kids are gonna love him,i cant believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is whats in their diapers
no i dont want any chocolate sheldon you cant train my girlfriend like a lab rat,actually it turns out i can
well theyve deployed our solution lets just all hope it works,i dont see why i have to worry my careers not hanging in the balance that was a joke its funny because its true
good,one question
what are you doing in there,im making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas just a little experiment in pest control
well what is it then i did everything just the way you like it,you did
hmm can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation,we can but thanks to steve jobs we dont have to
oh im so sure im going to regret this but who was i with,the fun loving and morally loose miss maggie mcgeary
howie that was amazing look im shaking,shes sick i knew it bye
yup im always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist,you tell people im a rocket scientist
the worlds greatest mom is in the shoe compartment,you ready to begin

oh my god a treasure chest im rich,level three and she thinks shes rich what a noob
do you have any idea what time it is,of course i do my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder colorado its accurate to one tenth of a second but as im saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical
im a cowboy on a steel horse i ride im wanted im wanted wanted dead or alive sheldon youre ruining girlfriendboyfriend singalong night,im sorry im looking for a barber and im running out of time my hair is growing at the rate of 4 6 yoctometers per femtosecond i mean if youre quiet you can hear it
we have chicken tortilla and potato leek,can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons
but there must be thousands of dollars here why dont you put it in the bank,i dont trust banks i believe that when the robots rise up atms will lead the charge
yes we win again,how could you not find him
a day,there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you
what,tubs are slippery
do you hear anything,i hear a womans voice
sheldon honey did you ever consider making friends by being i dont know pleasant,well thats certainly a thoughtprovoking hypothesis may i suggest it as the topic for your essay
sure whatever,you cant quit thats a courtmartial offence thats punishable by you cant quit
sheldon im more than smart enough to take your class,no
you really think theres some kind of scientific discovery in here,well this box only covers my work through nursery school theres a good deal more to come i didnt really hit my academic stride until i cut out that timesuck known as playing outdoors
well it wasnt the first suggestion that came to mind but its the one im going with,i cant sleep on your couch i sleep in a bed and given its dimensions i have no intention of living out e m snickerings beloved childrens book the tall man from cornwall
he still wont shag the old lady huh,no but thank you for asking
is it too much,not if youre a rugby team
sheldon all snow white needs is one little kiss to wake up,heard you the first time
what,i was going to mention it at the time but then i thought some day this might be a teachable moment
oh what a coincidence maybe you can discuss that with him while youre playing in the tournament sign here,i was such a fan that in 1995 i travelled ten hours by bus to a scifi convention in jackson mississippi wearing my star fleet academy cadet uniform in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint inpackage wesley crusher action figure
sheldon i am very very sorry,no no i brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life im going to need a ride to the mall
thats not ridiculous good night,do you have cufflinks
who is this justin,your turn leonard
exactly sometimes you cant win,captain kirk won
goodnight sheldon,penny hold on are you sure things cant work out with you and leonard
sheldon there are a million great vacations you could take what about hawaii,hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to lost was filmed mahalo for nothing hawaii
one more question,yes you must be present to win
hell have a shirley temple,and dont be chintzy with the shirley
uh were not sure but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother im not pregnant,may i have one of your fries
sheldon hold on could you maybe show me how to make more money with this,of course i could

football iâm going to pennyâs on saturday to watch a game with her friends and i donât want to look like an idiot i want to blend in,if you want to blend in with pennyâs friends iâd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage
all right you know what i will tell you why its wrong,excuse me may i interject
uh for starters we could stop insulting each other,thats a great idea and in the spirit of our new arrangement i will mask my surprise that you came up with it
you okay its you youre youre next,no youre crazy about me
cut yikes this guy is worse than wil wheaton,i dont know what shes talking about but im obligated to agree with her shes my girlfriend
milk,real cocoa
oh yeah those guys can be very stubborn whats the topic,i am asserting in the event that batmans death proves permanent that original robin dick grayson is the logical successor to the bat cowl
have you considered massage,id like to respond to that sarcastically yes i relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it
are you going to let me talk,im sorry
fine ill publish,can you believe this guy
great so you just let me know when you know so oh god i am the bad fish what did i do wrong,why are you asking me i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me nor do i have any method of learning such things
okay and if were talking about being left out of things you guys went to skywalker ranch without us,oh i recommend that too that was a magical experience
then get the other one pass the butter,get hang on i dont feel like youre taking this dilemma seriously
hey whats going on,oh youd like to catch up on the events of the day all right well there was a halfhour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems and oh yes in a moment filled with biblical resonance pride wenteth before my fall causing my flash 123 to goeth to wolowitz
sheldon if you were a robot and i knew and you didnt would you want me to tell you,that depends when i learn that im a robot will i be able to handle it
what,romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well
did you go to your prom,no i had a date with a proper education instead of a tuxedo i dressed myself in good habits instead of spiked punch i enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge instead of dancing in a gym i shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms
i like green lantern im just saying its pretty lame that he can be defeated by the colour yellow,only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow
yes,why
what you doing trying to contact your home planet,im practicing my theremin
thats amazing,yes leonards work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels while i appreciate the oh snap im uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear
i heard you call her brown sugar in my book thats defilement,you want to know my opinion
oh we are so taking you dancing,no you most certainly are not
oh and heres a fun thing i worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon planko and janko planko is a spoon with food janko is a spoon without food janko is spelled with a silent ptang sheldon youre not even listening to the rules of my madeup language,yes i am
by the way if it should ever come up you didnt join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos,why would i join you
you hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain,four keys who does he think he is a warden
no,oh it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule he would just go whenever the mood struck him
you know theres nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium but if you wanted we could build a fort,isnt that a little juvenile
alright and raj,and me
what,youre an actress correct
little ball of fur,thats not gonna work
no thats not a rule he can go,oh yeah
but you did do it so what if it didnt all go your way thats what makes it an adventure,thats a good point you know im a lot like gandalf the grey he fought the balrog and emerged stronger than ever as gandalf the white i was robbed of my phone and pants and i too came back stronger and whiter too cause i wasnt in direct sunlight for six weeks
what about your girlfriend,its too late i call dibs
ask what,who
i am not abandoning you sheldon abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep i am going to hollywood and thank a wax ronald reagan for his service to our country,we appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship mother
do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball,who said that leonard i can hear your voice but i cant see you
because love trumps hate,oh now youre just making stuff up
did leonard send you over here,no we havent spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton
yeah im sorry about that,im not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep
i uh huh,greetings from planet earth just turn left at alpha centauri you cant miss it
okay how about we toast your newfound freedom,ah normally i refrain from alcohol but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs why not soak it in grape juice thats been predigested by a fungus
and thats why you get an ipad helicopter,is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does
uh guys were locked in here,oh this day just keeps getting better
if you dont want to meddle then why are you meddling,if i may your parents probably dont consider this meddling while arranged marriages are no longer the norm indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their childrens lives
well putting aside the pig latin its a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so i didnt have to end it for you,amy after consideration i believe we may have acted rashly i propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences
whats your point,my point is were a couple and i like you for who you are quirks and all
i know i was looking forward to it,it wouldve been so nice to have a place that was ours where we could just sit and read comics in peace
oh my god are you okay,no im not okay uh im wearing borrowed pants i dont have i d and one of the officers here wont stop calling me chicken legs
oh sure sure yeah very christmassy,wait excuse me but its much more christmassy than anything youve put on the tree
im listening,your head goes on the other end
dont you dare missy,hello fastest man alive want to see me read your entire comic book want to see it again somethings wrong
and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night,your cell phone was off
guys this persons just going out of their way to get a rise out of you,yeah but its still so aggravating
oh come on really,first warning
sheldon do you have anything to say that has anything to do with you know what im talking about,well lets see we might consider schrodingers cat
which side do you come down on,ill let you know after tonight unlike some people im going in with an open mind who am i kidding of course we all know its ogauge or no gauge
you know i think were zeroing in on your problem,perhaps ill spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time unless theyre german cause thats a tough crowd
first new message,hawkman its your old buddy sheldonoscopy how come you didnt pick up the phone oh right my bad
what was that,you said be nice to penny i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice
everybody hurts sometimes everybody cries everybody hurts sometimes,she sounds weepy i dont like weepy lets go
sheldon you scared me that wasnt funny,or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex
whats the difference,jacuzzi is a commercial brand hot tub is the generic term i e all jacuzzis are hot tubs but not all hot tubs are jacuzzis
it is you just kind of put a damper on things when you said the next person i see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death,well we could argue about who said what all night long but to set things back on course i will propose a new topic of conversation
hello,hello listen ive been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be and i think
hugh who,hugh people need to listen to me its time to get in line for the movie and thats how you tell a knockknock joke
are you saying i do,oh no no no of course not its just i was thinking oh gosh golly i made a booboo and i gave it to stephen hawking
that is the last thing i want to do,thank you coconut what were you thinking are you a hula girl
you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise whats funny,that wasnt sarcasm
really,oh yes it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life id hate for that effort to have been in vain
oh great,yeah herbal tea for me please
thats very nice of you but i made other plans,well just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend i stand at the ready
no what do you want,you dont remember me how could he not remember me
what,i just found out that you recommended myself dr hofstadter and dr koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure
why,its culturally universal a bed even a temporary bed is always oriented with the headboard away from the door it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders
no but what is it,chicken broth it seemed culturally appropriate also there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when i moved in and its been bothering me for the last eight years so as they say two birds
i know what youre doing you dont want me going on this research trip because youre afraid to be alone,im not afraid to be alone on land on the sea it would be terrifying because of all the drowning
a little the real danger is him biting my face off while im sleeping,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me
i guess i know that its just part of me wants more,more i mean look at us its only been three years here we are in bed together
sheldon,oh it wont hurt my feelings go ahead amy say im annoying im annoying im annoying im annoying yeah now uh now where are you going look you know you want to say it say it say im annoying go ahead say it say it say it amy say it well she cant stand it when im right
okay fine where is she going to sleep,my room of course
sheldon why are you arguing with the dmv,how else are they going to learn look question 2 when are roadways most slippery now okay there are three answers none of which are correct the correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction
childrens toy,one star trek
whoa whoa wait a second whos they,xbox
leonard call me if youre interested in coitus sincerely maggie mcgeary,and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this
why would you open mine,i didnât that was a lie i opened my own toy and it was already broken so i switched them
you guys are going out two nights in a row,i missed a number of date nights while i was on my train trip and im contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the relationship agreement
um no offence but ive been acting since i was a kid i think i can handle a web show without a lot of direction,its true in 1982 wil played the voice of martin the mouse in the secret of nimh you moved me
you mean tings like moostache,well isnt this nice sometimes the baby wins
okay the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them,okay i see so not a dvd burner
no,leonards right we cant just jump ahead we have to watch the whole movie
well sorry i let you down,no i do not accept this everything is changing and i hate it it stops now im helping you get back on your feet i would like to purchase this comic book please
oh fun i get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the village people,you make that joke every three months i still dont get it leonard wait what are you doing
no but your thumb does,oh dear
yeah i wish,were not flying were taking the train
you know sometimes stuff just happens and theres nothing you can do about it for example lisa peterson hasnt talked to me since the 11th grade because no matter how much you apologize you cant go back and undryhump someones boyfriend,i see youre saying im facing starfleet academys unwinnable command scenario the kobayashi maru
these things happen all the time sheldon,not to me the only other retraction i ever had to issue was when i was seven and i conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in east texas but that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit
what,my stature intimidates her so shes using you to get to me crafty old gal
great now that were all on the same page lets get together tonight and work on it,get together tonight leonard stop trying to control everything and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do go ahead raj
really youre changing the sheldonian calendar,its a small price to pay
sheldon can i come in,i dont think thats a good idea
wwwuh no no hang on uh uh roommate agreement no hootenannies singalongs or barbershop quartets after ten p m,roommate agreement are you kidding we are living in a world of chaos roommate agreement
why not,amy from time to time we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves
oh thats so sweet of you but i was gonna steal food from here you know my treat,wait if howards mother is coming then you should also steal marbles because shes obese and hippos are obese and in the popular board game hungry hungry hippos they eat marbles maybe i need to dumb these down for you
well you shouldnt,theres just no pleasing you is there leonard you werent happy with my previous approach to dealing with her so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques building on the work of thorndike and b f skinner by this time next week i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool balancing a beach ball on her nose
no,yes
yeah i dont think i need my preshow urination anymore,leonard when that woman moved in three years ago i told you not to talk to her and now look were going to be late for the movies
young man ive been studying insects since i was eight years old you know what they used to call me in school creepy crawley,cruel as that may be that is not in itself a credential
penny,what thats absurd penny has no interest in subatomic particle research
sheldon its three oclock in the morning,three in the morning is a good time for bongos
well thats not your fault,i called the department secretary to see what happened apparently i have a reputation for being obnoxious
of course i like amy,well theres the difference
sheldon just buy scalped tickets with us,i told you buying scalped tickets is against the rules if you get caught you get banned from comiccon for life life leonard youre gonna feel pretty silly when were 80 years old and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days
one step ahead of you bernadette and wolowitz are going with us,oh very well what are the sleeping arrangements weve only been dating for three years if we were to share a room people might talk
come on someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it i thought you texas guys stood up for your womenfolk,penny please i think ive evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing
yeah no problem,of course not
i dont think the managers coming tonight so here,are you suggesting i sleep on the couch
uh im not sure everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up,since its not bee season you can have my epinephrine
not for twenty six hundred years,project gorilla entry two i am exhausted
perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons,acting lessons interesting it might help if i could act as though i care about my students and whether or not they learn
kidding just a couple of friends goofin around,no goofy no
morning,look leonard penny made french toast
thats pretty cool,oh yes it runs on the worlds most powerful graphics chip imagination
okay here,i should note im having some digestive distress so if i excuse myself abruptly dont be alarmed oh a napkin
sheldon why are you ignoring your sister,im not ignoring my sister im ignoring all of you
excuse me you are at valentines dinner with your girlfriend now get back over there and be with her,youre right that was insensitive of me i have to go back to my table now you should join us
hold on youre thinking of going there,carlsbad is only a couple of hours away
yeah freaky,have a chocolate
it does but in my experience you dont,there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
how about we just talk,all right in 4d chess
oh okay ill just go home and be alone which is cool i eat alone i sleep alone i cry alone so cool,darn if you werent busy id ask you to join us
really so were playing dungeons and dragons and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon isnt that a little on the nose,when you play chutes and ladders do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders
yeah hi listen as long as im here im on a quest with a bunch of noobs they dont know what theyre doing weve got one assassin three spellcasters and no tnk,can we talk about this later
wait im leaving my car here,yes and be sure and put on the emergency brake really makes these things tough to budge
thats not your lunch sheldon those are the cadaver brain specimens,oh as they were incorrectly sliced you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi
switching it up from last year when we came as the justice league of america,to that point it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare best group costume if we shore up our weak link which is clearly leonard as superman
please wait until i get into the hall,okay well good night
duhduhduhduhduhduh,if thats morse code thats terrible as i was saying you and leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter earlier this evening leonard characterized it as just fine so what youre seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed
howd you do,ill tell you exactly how he did readiness
oh sure i am,no no let me do the math for you this car weighs lets say 4 000lb now add say 140 for me 120 for you
come on,arent you afraid ill embarrass you
yeah,why on earth are you telling me all this
were doing everything we can,you know sherlock holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus but im sure those cool ranch doritos are doing the trick
its this jimmy speckerman thing i cant decide if i should agree to see him or not of course that might be because the last time i ran into him he made me floss with my own shoelaces,wear loafers look at dr saul perlmutter up there clutching that nobel prize whats the matter saul you afraid someones going to steal it like you stole einsteins cosmological constant
i dont know tell her im sick,okay
yeah good for you,oh wait did you want to talk about whats bothering you
i think were gonna go,are you sure we were making fun of failed careers we didnt get to tap the juicy vein that is howards
im feeling a little backed into a corner sheldon,perfect now im considering investing in stuarts comic book store
does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count,i should think so
whats that,thats a drawing of a really cool train dont look at that either what do you want
sure thats another way to go,penny penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm well that was a little nonresponsive
for gods sake ma im 27 years old its not even a school night comfy now,meh that poster of halle berrys a little unnerving
i dont know,may i say something
you can if you try think about it this way if i were batman and you were alfred youd keep that secret right,why do you get to be batman
thats right,oh james i could listen to your stories all night
i dont know,why dont you ask her
terrific its just that i dont think penny wants me to go,assuming thats a valid reason not to go which it isnt how do you know this did she say it
oic,what does that stand for
okay youre in sheldonopolis,where exactly sheldon square sheldon towers sheldon stadium home of the fighting sheldons
what would you like to talk about sheldon why do you hate us,ive prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists
yeah they sucker punch you when your eyes are closed,so what do you think howard its not that bad right
well weve all seen your mom that butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost,twelve hundred dollars thats my final offer
i got to tell you sheldon i understand why you chose this spot i mean the temperature is good but theres no draft i can see the television but i can still talk to,i changed my mind get out of my spot
youve been working so much lately im glad you didnt forget about date night,of course
whats wrong with your face,theres no reason to bring my looks into this good day leonard
i dont know but the girls do a lot for us its the least we can do,oh thats true i suppose its only fair we make compromises
i gotta say i am really impressed this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even,it may be lowtech but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity
are you willing to risk it,curse you
suddenly im looking pretty good huh,so uh kripke i was wondering if theres any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer
oh come on try me,all right ive devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions ive got nothing to show for it and i feel like a fool
oh great ive always wanted to play dungeons and dragons,yeah oh im sorry i shouldve mentioned this earlier youre not invited
well theres this girl i know from back in nebraska christie well anyway she called me up and shes like hey hows california and im like awesome cos you know its not nebraska and the next thing i know shes invited herself out here to stay with me,8
good night,good night appendicitis what a nervous nelly
he knows wow,well now but do you think thats a good idea uh you know star trek should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition
so fish,i read an article about japanese scientists who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals and i thought hey fish nightlights
yes,you and i have a standing tv schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise any alterations except for breaking news have to be preapproved at the weekly roommate meeting
oh youâre welcome,amy amy amy letâs wrap things up out there
do you mean that,yes yeah just put on your squeaky shoes and eeeeeeeee your way out of my life
howard raj and i just had a team meeting,no you didnt
well lets just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of temple beth el anyway she broke up with him and shes basically been alone ever since she never said it but i always felt i was the reason why,im sorry although based on your story you absolutely were the reason why
mmm im gonna say not thats just based on me trying to roll my mom over when shes snoring speaking of that big side of beef uh shes invited all of you to thanksgiving at her house,mmm you know ive been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse so id love to go but unfortunately that sounds awful
ugh,penny
oh well in that case perhaps i should come along,well now that i think about it that would be most helpful
thats true he didnt just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains he he broke out and poisoned gothams water supply,well i suppose i could poison kripke
whatcha doin,oh it turns out amys beloved pride and prejudice is a flawless masterpiece hes got too much pride shes got too much prejudice it just works
yeah just as well its a pretty rare piece id rather just sell it to a real collector,im a real collector how rare is it
wait wait sheldon come back you forgot something,what
sounds great,so in a way its like im your son
wuh penny,i dont know the first thing about women but i would not follow her
since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement they are all equally correct however i know you believe in the many worlds interpretation so ill say that now do you think im smart enough,no
come on sheldon cant you at least try to understand how much this means to me,round two leonard hofstadter darth vader rupert murdoch
sheldon we have to go,why
hes living at my place so im living here,youre living here provisionally but i must say its looking good
i feel terrible i did this,it pains me to say it but i think some form of penalty is in order so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future
hang on sheldon is proving that you are singlehandedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team,i dont understand the question
no no no you know they have suffered enough everybodys suffered enough the thing is youre going to have to offer him a facesaving way out of this,how
would you mind if we talked about mr wolowitz now,a little but go on
im the astrophysicist astro means space,astro means star
hey all set what do you think theres plenty of room for everybody a view out the window,my spot on the couch has a great view of a window sometimes i can see space battles through it its called a tv
why dont i just start sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if on a subconscious level they dont feel they deserve them do you think maybe thats whats happening here,really leonard youre just going to try to recycle adlers doctrine of the inferiority complex i could probably get that from the woman at ralphs and shed let me taste some pieces of cheese for free
and you love the sound of your own voice,yeah well of course i do listen to it its like an earful of melted caramel
i doubt it but if anyone has a chance its probably you,i feel very comfortable around you
its called the born again boat ride christian quarterly gave it their highest rating five thorny crowns i do wish youd come with me sheldon,well mom if i did it would be conclusive proof that your god can work miracles
hey sheldon you busy,im always busy this mind is capable of advanced multitasking you know currently im attempting to solve the penrose conjecture im composing my nobel acceptance speech for when ive solved the penrose conjecture and im wondering how mermaids have babies
double guacamole,of course
we both know thats your koala face,i told you
im an mittrained engineer ive built components for the space station,i thought the zerogravity toilet didnt work
why whats so unusual about me having a date,well statistically speaking
that was pretty badass dude,i help the weak its yet another way im exactly like batman
oh good youre up look my car wont start i need a ride to work,did you once again ignore your check engine light
thats not my mom its bernadette,really thats very unsettling
you dont have to bite my head off,i apologize i just im plagued by an internal struggle
uh okay okay uh we we get it,"perhaps youd prefer this one 
 the itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all 
 because it has eight legs 
 and two body parts"
you would go to a beach house,well good lord no have you seen jaws
well you know how he is hes sensitive and emotional,thats because he drinks too much soy milk
thats what i said before i knew it he pontificated his way right into my heart,uh fun fact pontificate comes from the latin word pontifex which means bridge builder or pope
look i know you dont like it but thats the point of the experiment i need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone and you said no to tickling polka music or watching me eat a banana,who eats them horizontally
getting one,are you currently pregnant
no we agreed they all have their merits this was about bernadette,whats going on
im going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isnt so overwhelming,by playing tictactoe

im sowwy can you wepeat that,well of course scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons spock spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves spock spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors
dont take this away from me,i didnt care for her yelling but now that im not going to hear it again im sad
how,hmm itd have to be something heinous something that makes her as miserable as shes making me oh ive got it this is good
not always unless your date drives a van with an air mattress then always,well if its part of the prom experience then im open to it
it doesnt matter nothing matters,if youd like to take your mind off whats troubling you uh word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted
and that is,using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny
thats because in your dreams youre a horse from the waist down,excuse me wolverine
yeah she works at a law firm in new york,yes but shes the only monster at the firm between you me and the wall i think shes an affirmative action hire
what was what,this isnt a very good connection but it sounded like someone just released a kraken
they didnt quit they were massacred by like a gazillion angry mexicans,alright let me put it this way your gross receipts on this one order will be over 3 000 for one nights work
wwwait whats going on,i assume youre referring to the sea shanty its a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity
i dont even know why i care i dont care all right i cared enough to memorize that stupid joke but thats all i care,you know penny theres something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting occasionally a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power when this happens the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains

i hate to say it but she did kind of betray you,interesting you see betrayal in others but not yourself
wow that flag is a lifesaver,no this is stop looking at my legs

ive had enough of your condescension maybe i didnt go to college when i was eleven like you maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation,so you admit that youre an egotist
thats all,before taxes
whatâs up,i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me
thats how much buying a comic book store means to me,id like your honest opinion on something
but youre okay with superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses,he doesnt just put on a pair of glasses he combs back his curlicue and affects a mildmannered personality
hey,hello
sheldon theres a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering,and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you bubbula but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes
look sheldon sweetie i know youre feeling insecure but weve really got to go to sleep,all right ill take the first watch and wake you at 0400
its your assistant alex isnt it,no no no this is tondelaya della ventimiglia
this is a door knob,its my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat
sheldon,ugh fine ill go but if her food is delicious thanksgiving is ruined and its on you
oh,2530 east andy devine avenue
nice to finally meet you in person,i would imagine it is this is my friend and roommate dr leonard hofstadter

hey sheldon can i talk to you for a second,its not about shoes is it i dont think i could go through that again
come on its just a video game and we suck at it,nice motivational speech from the team captain
thats really not the sort of thing were interested in,you heard me say bluray right

yes,talk to him
yeah,well i dont think you have a sht there i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs now given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability
i cant leave now sheldon im very busy besides why would i want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria image number four boa constrictor,what on earth are you talking about my behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful maybe your friend gn needs to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humour
oh hey guys you having a good time,given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system
great,you still didnt pick a date
what,ive never knocked on my own door before that was a wild ride
i think what hes trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit,a little bit the man super glued hersheys kisses to your nipples
we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla and play reallife operation,no
but this is other money,how does it different from the money i have

no its all over,i cant believe it
i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother,no misunderstanding ive learned what that request actually means and i dont want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis
i think youre really going to enjoy yourself today not only do you get to meet my relatives but since my aunts nursing home is catering the party all of the food is incredibly soft its like a vacation for your teeth,all right
noones going to ask if i spent the night with rajs sister,perhaps but they might ask me something else

well then why are you going,its a comic book convention you know its like pizza or particle accelerators even the stinky ones still pretty good
how about that gorn sitting on the couch,that seems fairly conclusive no gorn no thats where i sit
mmm hows leonard doing,he seems all right although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on oh but now that i think of it he asked me not to tell you that
bonjour mademoiselle i understand youre new in town,oh good grief

you know checking email updating my facebook status messing up wikipedia entries hey did you know netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now,and youve continued to take the universitys money under false pretences highly unethical for an astrophysicist although practically mandatory for a pirate
hey what if i took your class,why would you do that

why,why oh penny penny penny

yeah uh i really dont think i do,but i dont drive and i cant take the bus
shes just so impossible they keep quitting,so whos watching her now
i love little house it made me want to live on a farm so much i tried to milk my cat that tangy bowl of cheerios was not worth the stitches,well you sit back relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory you see that cabin there i read they were illegally squatting on indian land yeah personally i think what we did to the native americans was wrong but this is your favourite show not mine oh look at little laura ingalls eating that peanut butter sandwich peanut butter huh thats strange since peanut butter wasnt introduced until the early 1900s if i knew this show was about time travel i would have watched it much sooner
they asked me to come in,well i didnt hear the phone ring
so youre looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages,amy has a fondness for the comic strip marmaduke
hey,hello i see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened
well you better have a good excuse this time because trimming qtips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense,first of all when you say things like that people think youre crazy second the reason im cancelling is because i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman

you you get bit a lot let me see if if i have this straight you you two are are physicists and you and you want me to do a childrens science show,yes and if theres time take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing
which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negativeenergy density as spacetime so what do you think what do you think so what do you think,hmm
how about that,personally i would never use a transporter because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon
all right apology accepted have a nice night,no no now that weve cleared the air i wanted to discuss another matter with you
hey sheldon help you with anything,yes im attending a party this weekend for a 93yearold woman can you recommend a gift

im always hoping but tonight i just wanted to have a nice time with you and maybe dance with someone who has arms,thank you for understanding
hey sheldon the new green lantern figurines coming in tomorrow want me to set one aside for you,thank you you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the ohsosatisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession
thats because i dont,just look see this first question makes no sense how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving theres no possible way to answer that a car length is not a standardized unit of measure
oh careful youre poking at the whole foundation of the bachelor,yeah but we dont have to debate this were scientists we can conduct our own research i propose that we imprison two street people and

its all right sheldon i will just pretend that leonards not withholding information although i will point out leonard that i am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate,isnt she brilliant leonard how i envy you
oooaw this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath what,i was analysing our lie and i believe were in danger of penny seeing through the ruse
should we have invited her for lunch,no were going to start season two of battlestar galactica
sheldon youre not in charge raj is in charge,leonard whos really in charge the person in charge or those who put him in charge

i know i want to talk to you,what would we talk about weve no overlapping areas of interest im aware of and you know i dont care for chitchat
in what universe is that a present,its not a present its the present look theres you and me theres penny and amy were playing pictionary in the present
all thats left to do is stare into each others eyes for four minutes without talking,okay wait hang on bladder check were good to go
sheldon,howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased he intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence
i dont think you mean we cant i think you mean we shouldnt,hey howard youre a jew if there was another wailing wall exactly like the one in jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs would you still be able to wail at it okay its definitely me
okay raj hand me the number six torque screwdriver,stop we cant do this its not right
everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring why not put a little mocha in the family latte,in principle you have a point but as a practical matter need i remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex
all right indiana jones plays no role in the outcome of the story if he werent in the film it would turn out exactly the same,oh i see your confusion you dont understand indiana jones was the one in the hat with the whip

sheldon we know this is a sensitive subject and leonards not gonna move out until youre ready,well what if you did it gradually

still havent heard from her,no and im confused its been nearly 24 hours amy should have figured out shes wrong by now
which is stronger than ever,which is stronger than ever this is about you trying to change my environment which was perfect the way it was
going home where i wont be interrogated like a criminal i forgot my fortune cookie,in case either of you have larceny in your heart you should know that ive moved my money out of the snake can
i dont know the bisexual gorilla gogo dancer in schindlers list is tough to bat,ah very good because a gorilla gogo dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust

the ball the ball the ball the ball the ball the ball,thank you jesus as my mother would say
oh no no you see in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator so that hes warm yet not so close that he sweats in the summer its directly in the path of a crossbreeze created by opening windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that isnt direct so he can still talk to everybody yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted,perhaps theres hope for you after all

well have you considered telling her how you feel,leonard im a physicist not a hippie
i dont need any insights i just want to know why pennys more interested in stuart than me were practically the same guy,oh i disagree stuart is taller artistic selfemployed and most significantly he gets 45 percent off comic books
you cannot blow up my head with your mind,then ill settle for an aneurysm
so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit,because he is neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be the flash

i just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera you know like like a real conversation its something we work on in my acting class,interesting a few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic perhaps that isnt the compliment it sounds like
im very tempted im just not sure its appropriate with my sons roommate,normally id feel the same way but based on everything ive observed about us i cant help but speculate wed be very good together
well they have a lot in common i mean theyre both scientists,oh please the only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space

jealousy what do i have to be jealous of,i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female you have none

thanks our culprit is one mr todd zarnecki 2711 ocean view road carlsbad california,the name and the address drip with evil
come on sheldon you have to get her something,why should i she knows that i dont like christmas and yet every year she forces me to celebrate it not only am i going to this foolish dinner against my will at the christmas tree lot there was mistletoe and she kissed me under it in public like we were the stars of a tijuana sex show

well i dont have to pay taxes on this stuff,i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree but if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques and you optimized your manufacturing process you might be able to make this a viable business
okay fine i did say that and i think its true i think if we worked together and lived together wed get sick of each other,yeah but to be fair he only said the part about him getting sick of you
just wait,you realize penny that the technology that went into this arm will one day make kll food servers such as yourself obsolete

i think the real question is why do you waste your time with cheap childish pranks,theres probably a deep reason which id be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can
oh i love san francisco i wish i was going with you,i understand your envy this is a cantmiss symposium there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices the advancements in multithreaded task completion plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium greens function approach to the photoionization process in atoms

why dont you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with leonard and you miss him,you overestimate his significance in my life
except for raj,well i hope youre satisfied penny you are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today
wow you really do love her,i do now lets find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless
what why,you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition would you ask picasso to play pictionary would you ask noah webster to play boggle would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish
no,then were probably okay
thats pretty,where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few where the rain never falls and the sun never shines yes its dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
all right,unless it gets to the old woman in time in which case she sucks out the poison turning her into the grand empress a piece combining the power of the knight queen and serpent

and yes even shed a tear or two,like when you do a twohour fourth of july spectacular and it doesnt get recorded
okay i get it i get it i get it,do you know its amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out
well why,im attempting to turn over a new leaf earlier today it was pointed out to me that i tend to force my ideas on people
im getting worried about bernadette im gonna call and check on her,the national science foundation wants to give me a substantial grant

shes pretty good huh,she is but when do they get to the part about streetcars
seconded,there being no objections
and as long as were talking about betraying our friends how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into leonards food,well excuse me that was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy
so youre like one of those beautiful mind genius guys,yeah
maybe john connors aboard and shes protecting him from an evil terminator,unlikely thats a television show leonard
okay if youre gonna start sniffing people im gonna go get a hot pretzel,excuse me do you have any books about making friends

i smell chinese food,its actually thai youre slipping
no wait wait no wait wh what are you doing here,a reasonable question i asked myself what is the most mindnumbing pedestrian job conceivable and three answers came to mind uh toll booth attendant an apple store genius and what penny does now since i dont like touching other peoples coins and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius here i am
guys sorry im late i have amazing news,bernadette before you change the subject does anyone have any final comments on leonards faulty digestive system
penny kissing me is not insane she used to kiss me all the time,einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results by that standard penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs

shall i wait,yes please how may i help you
you know for an extra four bucks i can have this thing here tomorrow,well i know it was your idea but the reporter said hes been following my work for a while and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is cause my name is on it
what do you mean,according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson in order to maximize performance one must create a state of productive anxiety so id like to ask you all to do something for me keep me on my toes just throw me off my game essentially go out of your way to make my life miserable
get rid of her how,i dont know but apparently im in some kind of relationship and you seem to be an expert at ending them
and you,enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price the manager recognized wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine right next to it i was closer to it than i am to you right now
id say it now but look at those cheekbones,i miss stuarts place all this loud music and exposed brick what is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pigs house

where no sheldon has gone before,its the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century where his genius is not only appreciated but celebrated
you heard that ladies night ladies were eventually coming for you,fascinating
sheldon whats the point,just like schrodingers cat your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that youll find out which it is
hey sheldon,hello penny
no im saying you and string theory sound like a relationship and i know what its like to be in one and realize its never gonna turn out the way you want,i said leonard you said no
as i was saying,youre telling it wrong ira to really understand the story here you have to start at the very beginning a small town in east texas where a young genius named
not in a rush busy with work,things are good right now
uh i was hoping you wouldnt notice irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes and sadly as it turned out space heaters,ladies please these four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach but through no ones fault penny the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined and again im looking at no one in particular penny
you had a panic attack when we went through the car wash,perhaps the emotion youre referring to was shock at you having something cleaned
sure what are you doing,im trying to get the hair out of my eyes
i hate to tell you but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd,youre clearly misremembering your mother is brilliant analytical insightful and im betting she never hit you with a bible because you wouldnt eat your brussels sprouts
well uh i cant believe you used sheldons toothbrush,you used my toothbrush
maybe,leonard penny excellent id like to say im very happy that youre back together and if i can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere i will in the meantime id like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address pennys annoying personal habits

what do you think sheldon want an action figure that looks just like you,would it come with kungfu grip

okay sheldon sit down,if theres going to be a theme i should let you know that i dont care for luau toga or under the sea
no ones saying that lets go,well it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99cent adhesive ducks we both might die in a fiery car crash
yeah,i still dont care
could you tell us,lets see snake eyes sorry bud
dont you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction,our apartment was broken into our security system tried to kll me and as a result im leaving pasadena forever tell me how thats overreacting

oh yeah,im so proud of you you sold yourself out like a common streetwalker
huh that does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me lets get our minds off how uncomfortable we are we could take some more simulated instrument readings,my major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay

quick pull the fire alarm lets get out of here,uh hello again um yeah i dont know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences but its clear you young women here today have been while i was listening to my colleagues waste your time it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science and uh i happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now uh dr rostenkowski dr fowler are you there
great how,we pretend were aliens im not the best at reading facial cues but im gonna say that you love it and want to hear more now in the beloved novel hitchhikers guide to the galaxy an alien named ford prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about earth for the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which is a travel book within the actual book which is also called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy

well thats got to be a good feeling,oh it is although
ooh i dont like where this is going,i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me
you know if no ones thought of this yet this could be a big deal,only way well know for sure is if we post it online to the preprint server i have it ready to go but i wasnt gonna do it without you
okay,excuse me is it at all possible that youre knitting a pair of pants oh well no youre understandably terrified but you know allow me to explain 45 days ago um i embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory and my favorite comic book store brned down and when my room mate got engaged my girlfriend wanted to move in with me which was no doubt a ploy just to see my well excuse my language but my bathing suit parts uh sir may i use your phone
okay i think ive narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip,very impressive you know when youre done with that can you look at this it doesnt make smoke anymore
oh like youve never thought of doing that dont hate me just because i lived the dream,hey sweet ride
thank you dr cooper,yeah additionally you should know that the university has mandated that i take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesnt happen in the future

on the count of three one two,wait im a little concerned blueberries are rich in antioxidants
yes i did,and you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration
i see a problem,our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people
sheldon,thats right sheldon cooper he was bitten by his neighbours dog leading to his first scientific breakthrough the doggie deathray which sadly he couldnt build because santa wouldnt bring him enriched uranium
sheldon i dont understand i thought you said you were fine with it,well i was but that was before howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other
look youre here we have plenty of room,no we dont
it gets better someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist and guess who that someone is,mohammed lee

sorry im having dinner with penny i have to get out of here,and i have flag knowledge that i have to get out of here
guys listen up,cant listen zone also dont care
so a few things dont go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo,i suppose it is except i have a credit card and i refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick and id sooner die than eat beans out of a can
oh god,and it was literally the moment you walked out the door but i see the type of personal revelations youre going for okay heres one i thought id take to the grave
all right well if im understanding this right and all she did was help out another scientist im thinking you might have to let this one go,ugh let it go i have heard that my whole life every time something upsets me somebody says let it go you know like its my fault and its not okay to feel the way i feel
