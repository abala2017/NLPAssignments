 Inherent to our mission is a commitment to ensuring our coverage reflects the diversity of our communities and the people we serve. It is essential that our staff also is diverse and that we foster an inclusive workplace for all. Annually, we will publish a snapshot of who we are and the steps we are taking that lead to progress. We’ve produced an analysis of the gender and racial/ethnic balance of our newsroom, leadership and our coverage area as of July 1, 2022.
