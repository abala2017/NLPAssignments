The way this program works is that the program takes in an input in the form of a data.csv and processes all the person objects in it to make a dictionary of person objects. It then pickles the dictionary and reloads it and displays the data to make sure the pickle worked correctly.


To run this code, you need to go into the terminal and naviagte to the folder containing homework1_axb200075.py and enter the following command:

>>> python homework1_axb200075.py 'data/data.csv'

Python is really helpful for text processing as the language is incredibly simple yet customizable. It is really easy to pick up, but also difficult to master. There are many ways to do things which offer methods to making the code run more efficiently which can also be a big asset when working with code that runs for thousands of iterations.

I reviewed the ways that we can crete classes in python as well as the way to pickle and unpickle objects in python.
